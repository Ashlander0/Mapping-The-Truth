Canada,Canada,Alberta,-116.5765035,53.9332706,,"About three years ago i encountered what I could only explain then as a deformed hyena. It was in the later part of the day under dusky condidtions and I was small game hunting at the time. I did not feel any fear because I was carrying my over-under shotgun at this time. It's eyes were kind of strange and I remember it had very pointy ears. It's head was almost cartoon like as it's snout had messed up over grown hair, it's fangs look unusaully long too. For sometime before I seen it I heard a very very long coughing noise, like a cat coughing up a fur ball. However this went on for a long time, so whatever did it had strong & large lung capacity. I doubt a lynx or cat could have been the noise maker. I have no idea if this dog like creature was the source of this strange and long coughing fit. Another strange thing along this trail, I always seemed to be under the watchful eyes of a high flying turkey vulture. Now these are newcomers to Alberta, but a few mating pairs have been reported up here, and this is common local knowledge that no one questions. This coughing bout I have heard at least oncve before in this specific area. Never seen the source in the nearby dense boreal forest. This wooded area is kind of on the edge of oil exploration and is an active work area now. So I don't hunt there anymore. Which is too bad as it's chalk full of small game such as rabbits and grouse. During this encounter the woods were un-naturally quiet. it's hard to move in many areas off trail because the ever green limbs reach so far close to the ground an upright person would be stooped over to move at any kind of speed in many areas. Quadrapeds have a definite advantage here over people, and the area is also ringed with swamps and marshy very uneven gorund that one could easily turn your ankle on. There were other strange moments then, I think when I did see this animal, I sat down on a large rock with my gun across my lap and caught the first glimpse, as it was circling me I think to catch my scent on the wind. I just caught a glimpse of it passing behind a tree in the dusky light conditions. It had hocks like a dog. But as it came around the tree, still on all four legs I noticed the front legs werre longer then the back legs, its back bowed upward and I got the distinct impression it's forntal back, chest and leg muscles were much more pronounced and muscular than it's back legs. I believe the front coat was a lighter color with some reddish tones too. Looked like a hyena loose in North America to my own eyes. It ws not a black bear. I am very familiar with bears. It was canine like, but not any canine I have ever seen before or since. My brother (he was not there) found a near perfect picture of another critter on line, on another crypto site, and the picture was said to be taken very near the Wisconsin River. In the picture it looked like it was on farmland corral or fenceline, in the early spring because of white and light snow cover. Was the near twin to what I saw that fall evening in Alberta. "
Canada,Canada,Deadwood Alberta,-117.458219,56.740963,,"I came across another report of a bipedal canine. I was at a Sportman's show here in Alberta & had been talking about Sasquatch with a group of people. After the discussion was over a young woman approached me and said that her father had seen ""a werewolf"" on their farm in the mid 1990s. She said that he was there at the show & she wondered if I would talk with him. I was more than happy to, as reports of bipedal canines are few and far between in Alberta. I was introduced to the father, who was less than happy that his daughter had told a stranger about his sighting of creature that isn't suppossed to exist. But after I told him who I was and what I did, he seemed relieved that I wasn't going to ridicule him. We went outside and sat at a picnic table, and he related the occurrence to me. Occurrence: The witness lives on a sizeable piece of land near Deadwood, Alberta. He raises, boards, and breeds horses for a living. One night in early August of 1996 the witness was awoken by the sounds of panicked horses; he said that they sounded as if they were being or were going to be attacked by something. He grabbed a 250,000 candlepower spotlight & a 20 gauge shotgun and headed out towards the sounds. It should also be noted that his dog refused to leave the house with him. This was very unusual, as the dog is trained for running off animals that may attempt to harm the horses. As he approached a corral were several shetland ponies were being kept, he spotted movement. He clicked on his spotlight and played the beam over the area, when the beam passed over a corner section of the corral he spotted what he thought was a large timberwolf. This surprised him, as he had never had problems with wolves before. Still, this ""wolf"" was making itself a problem, so he shouted ""Hey! Hah! Get the hell out of here!"" What happened next shocked and stunned him, the ""wolf"" spun towards him and stood up on its hind legs. He estimated that the creature's height was between 6.5 to 7 feet, the color was jet black, and the eyeshine was said to be greenish-yellow. He immediately pointed the shotgun at it and pulled back both hammers, when he did this the creature began to emit a growling sound/vocalization that the witness described as ""A steady and somewhat guttural growling"". He remembers whispering to himself ""Oh my god. This isn't possible..."" over and over again. As he was doing this the creature started to go into a crouch, the witness took this to mean that the creature was going to lunge at him so he fired the shotgun in its direction. The creature dopped onto all fours and bolted, faster than he thought possible for an animal to move, in the forest. After the creature moved out of view, the witness began to get a very uncomfortable feeling like he was being watched. What he described as an unreasonable fear came over him and he fled towards his home as fast as he could move. He considered calling the police, but soon cancelled that thought. What would he tell them? That he had just fired at a werewolf? No, he kept this to himself, only telling his daughter when she was in her late teens. I asked the witness if he thought he hit the creature with the shotgun blasts. He believes that he did, but the damage would have been minimal as he was using #7 birdshot, the worst that may have happened was that the pellets caused it stinging pain. The duration of the sighting was estimated to be between 45 seconds and one minute. The distance from the witness to the creature was estimated to be between 40 to 50 yards. The witness only ever told me his first name: Lloyd. He also mentioned that if I ever used this report online or elsewhere, to change his first name to something else. The headache this would cause him in his small comminity is something he wishes to avoid at all costs. He seemed quite surprised when I told him that creatures like this had been spotted all over the United States & even in Quebec. The witness seriously thought that this creature was a werewolf, as he had nothing else to compare it to. He said that he lived in worry (if not fear) for a number of years afterwards, wondering if it was going to pay him another visit. He biggest worry was that it may harm his wife and/or daughter. The creature was never sighted again by the witness, and no other similar reports have surfaced. I asked the witness if he thought this could have been a person in a costume, he gave a resounding NO to that question. He said it just looked too natural, and that the speed it moved with was something that a person in a suit could never accomplish. He also said that no one in the area would be foolish enough to pull a stunt like that, because the end result would most likely be them getting shot."
Canada,Canada,Deadwood Alberta,-117.458219,56.740963,,"I received a report about an unusual wolf/wolf-like creature from a fellow this past summer. He was hiking the Mount Baldy trail here in Alberta when the encounter occurred. The behaviour of the animal was also extremely ""unwolf-like"", it was unresponsive & unafraid of things that a wild animal would be afraid of. Anyway, here is the report as I recieved it. ""I managed to get a few days off of work so I decided to hit some of the trails to do some hiking and exploring, I chose the trails around Mt. Baldy because I had been there many times before and knew them well. I was carrying a canteen of water, a small backpack containing a small first aid kit, a couple of well wrapped packaged snack bars, a small emergency survival kit & my digital camera. I was also carrying a 410 single-shot shotgun which I take with me on all my hikes & camping trips. I was about half of the way to the Mt. Baldy base trailhead when I was surprised by a very large wolf that just walked out on to the trail and stood there blocking my way, at first I was concerned because this creature was quite a bit bigger than any Timberwolf that I had ever seen, captive or wild. But the creature seemed content to simply stand and stare at me, I spoke to it & it didn't show that it had even heard the sound (no raising of the ears, etc), I yelled at it to get out of the way & it still did nothing. I began to feel uncomfortable so I started to back away, but the creature then came towards me. I stopped & so did it, I then took the shotgun off of my shoulder and fired it into the air, once again the creature did not seem to care. All it did was glance at the weapon, then right back to me again. By this time I had the nagging feeling in my head that this was not an ordinary wolf, it just did not behave like a wild animal, so I reached back into my backpack and removed my digital camera. This was the only thing that seemed to cause it to waver in its behaviour, for as I raised the camera to take a picture of it, it darted off into the woods. I took this moment to beat a retreat back down the trail towards a more open area. This next part may make you disbelieve the entire account, but I am going to say it regardless: When I looked back up the trail the creature was standing next to a large pine tree, but it was standing on its back legs!! I suppose it could have been using the tree for support, but it didn't look like it. I raised the camera once more and it disappeared back into the woods. Now what kind of wild animal is more afraid of a camera than of a gun?! This is why I don't believe I was dealing with an ordinary wolf, I may even go so far as to say it fringed on the paranormal. Needless to say I will not be hiking those trails ever again, armed or not. I know that you are a sasquatch researcher, but I couldn't find anyone else in Alberta that would know anything about this or even take the time to read it with out calling me a liar. I reported this large wolf to a **CO as I left the area. I told him that I had spotted an extremely large Timberwolf (easily the size of a Great Dane) on one of the trails, he replied that the wolves here don't get that big & that I must be mistaken. He probably thought I was a kook. And just a side note, I know for certain that this was not someone's escaped dog. It was a wild creature, it looked rough & had a feral look to it."" "
Canada,Canada,Deadwood Alberta,-117.458219,56.740963,,"In this report a husband and wife were out cross-country skiing. They had just crossed a remote country road & were about to ski across a field. On the other side of this field they spotted an extremely large wolf standing just inside of the treeline, the wife said she felt uncomfortable as the creature was staring right at them & following their movement. Her husband was carrying a .22 rifle on his back (on a sling), he brought the rifle down, chambered a cartridge, and fired into the ground in front of the creature. She said that the creature looked at the ground, then back at them, and began to growl. She said that the growl ""went up and down in sound"", and it was very deep & menacing. She said that her husband shouldered his rifle again but did not fire, what really gave her the chills was the look on the creature's face. She felt that the creature knew that the rifle was small caliber & was not something that could kill it with one shot. Moments later her husband fired again, this time into a tree that was next to the creature. The creature didn't even flinch, but what it did next made both of them flee in terror. About 30 seconds after the second shot, the creature stood up on two legs. One of its front legs (arms?) was against the tree that her husband shot. The growling continued, but it had increased in volume by quite a bit & the creature was moving its jaws up and down, like it was gnashing its teeth. Her husband fired three shots directly at the creature, all three hitting it in the chest. The creature let out a drawn out scream/howl and ran off into the forest on two legs, they fled the other way back towards their vehicle. As they were skiing back they had to pass through a small area of forest, as they were passing through the forest they could hear something running towards them from a distance through the woods. They cleared the woods without anything happening, but when they broke out of the forest they estimated that whatever was chasing them was no more than 35-40 yards behind them. She had her cell phone with her & was thinking about using it to take a picture of the creature. As she was thinking this she suddenly got a ""feeling"" that if she took a photograph, the creature would kill both of them. She said that the feeling was so strong that she immediately shoved the phone in her pocket. It wasn't as if the creature sent her a psychic message or anything, it was just a feeling. One thing she mentioned, in a hushed, embarrassed voice. When her husband and her made it back to their vehicle, she noticed that she had actually peed her pants. She didn't even notice until the adrenaline rush ended. She had actually been so scared that she lost control of her bladder, she always thought that was ""just something from the movies"".

Canada,Canada,Gillam Manitoba,-94.7748443,56.33341,,"I saw something that put a big scare into me. I'm going describe it - not sure you'll believe it, but I'm certain about what I saw that day. This happened in August 2009 as I was driving to my husband's place of employment. We live in Gillam, Manitoba and he is an electrician for one of the generating stations on the river. It was close to 3 PM. I had just turned off one of the residential roads near my home head-ing east on PR280. About a 1/2 mile after my turn, I caught a glimpse of something tall moving through the trees to my right. Then sudden-ly, it jumped onto the shoulder of the road and stood there as I drove by. I looked in the mirror and saw it quickly cross to the other side of the road. I picked up speed and didn't stop until I reached the station. I had chills all over. I got a decent look at it. It had a large wolf head, but it was standing upright on legs which looked man-like. I didn't see arms as I passed by, but I did see arms swaying back and forth when I looked in the mirror as it crossed the road. The coloring of the head and body hair was charcoal with darker patches. If it was an actual gray wolf, then it was the largest one I had ever heard of. I thought that someone was playing tricks, but that wouldn't make sense since (I think) it was during the hunting season. I did tell my husband, who later checked the area where I saw it. He said that there were reports of a very large wolf along the river a year or two before, but he had not heard anything beyond that. I still don't know if he believes me. I also said something to my uncle (through marriage) who is Chippewa. My uncle told me that it was not a ma'iingan (wolf) and that I must for-get about it. He then recited some words under his breath and told me not to mention it again. That kind of freaked me out. Since it was 5 years ago, I haven't thought much of it - until I read a newspaper article about the dogman and sightings people had in other locations. "
Canada,Canada,Léry Quebec,-73.8059179,45.3444129,,"An old friend and I cross the path of a dogman in the Centre écologique Fernand-Seguin in Chateauguay, a city situate in the province of Québec just at the south shore of Montreal. One week before our encounter, without knowing about it not until after our own encounter, the father of my friend encounter one in Lery, a town next to Chateauguay and connected to the natural park. The Chateauguay sighting happen during the summer of 2005, but for a long time, i always believe it was 2008 (( because i am bad at remembering date )), but my friend ((the second witness)) have recently refresh my memory about it. I am telling you that because i have already fill a report a couple years ago which can be found on this map written in a terrible english, with the wrong year and some missing information the father of my friend didn't tell us at this point ; https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=186_7hq4gxioA6hHZLmaWpCJWCng The chateauguay encounter ; the creature have following us all along the border of the forest in the entrance zone of the park, doing weird canin sounds, like it was upset or something, We managed to keep our calm the much we can and heading to the car which was at the fence directly at the entrance door of the natural park. At the moment we enter the car and my friend open the light of the car, my friend saw a 6 foot tall dogman looking right at the him at the other side of the fence, like at 2-3 meter from his car door. He only saw some of its facial feature and the eyes shines. (( Don't ask the color, he is daltonian..)) It was enough to get afraid like hell and move the car away of there. I never managed to saw the dogman directly and the creature didn't follow us after we departed. Lery sighting. which happen 1 week ish before our encounter ; The father of my friend and the ex-boyfriend of the sister of my friend get out of their chalet one night after hearing a weird commotion behind the chalet. ((By the way, the Chalet is build at the edge of a very big marsh, which connected to the natural park. )) My friend was there that night, but he didn't exist the chalet only at the end of the encounter. When the two of them arrived behind to find out what cause all of the noises, both of them saw a very large black dog, with large shoulder, eating something in the brush at 6-7 meter of them. The creature turn away and face them rapidly and begin to growing at them. The father follow up his instinct and get a large stick near of him and prepared himself for the worse. At this very moment, the creature stood up, make a very small step or two toward him continuing his growling. The father was shocked up from the scene and his daughter-boyfriend become white like a ghost. Few seconds after, the dogman step aside very fast, return on all four, run a very short distance to jump directly into the marsh to dissapear forever. My friend finally exist the chalet to join his father and his sister boyfriend only when the dogman escaped on all four, so for him at this time, it was only a very strange large dog. His father and the now ex-sister boyfriend NEVER tell to my friend the dog creature have stood up until my friend get his own encounter with me 1 week later. Since then, we speculated all of us have saw the same dogman or maybe a member of the same pack because of the forest connection between the natural park and his chalet. My friend family never saw any dogman again around the chalet since this summer, so we dunno if it was only passing by the sector that summer or it living around the sector but generally avoiding humans at all cost OR the peoples around don't want to talk about it to anyone. I don't have any other eyewitness of dogman in this natural park...maybe it was happen but i guess peoples will never dare to speak about it."
Canada,Canada,New Brunswick,-66.4619164,46.5653163,,"My grandfather told me this story when I was a teenager. I’m 52 now. My granddad grew up in the woods of Central New Brunswick, in a very remote area, where only survivalists go now. Their whole family lived out in the sticks. They lived by hunting, fishing, trapping, and some logging.

Granddad said, when he was a teenager, he and his older brother, Duke, were up, in the early hours, checking traplines, on an old motorbike. it was early fall. Frost was on the grass and early morning mists still hung around the forest edges. He was rolling cigarettes with his brother and they were out of matches, so they dipped a bit of cloth in the gas tank and ignited it off the coil wire, while duke kicked the bike over. The sound of a bike being kicked over, without an ignition, is sort of like an animal call. That’s how my granddad described it. Anyways; just as they started smoking their cigarettes, my grandfather noticed something bounding through the tree line, toward them. Granddad said it ran in a way a bear did, but it stopped several yards away from them and stood up, on its hind legs. It was still too far away to tell what it was, but they assumed it was a black bear because they are very common in New Brunswick. That’s when it began walking, upright, toward them. As it got nearer, Granddad said it looked like a huge Werewolf! His family origin was German, so this was not unknown. it got as close as 20 feet away from them and then began to eye them closely. It sniffed their smokes and then turned and hopped/ran back to the trees. Granddad said they were not scared. He said they were only shocked that such a creature was living in the woods. Granddad said it was taller than any man, had a huge head, evil eyes, long, upright ears, hands with long claws, and had hair all over its body. I can’t remember what color he said its fur was, but he said it had wolf like legs."
Canada,Canada,Ontario,-85.3232139,51.253775,,"I was driving home from work on a 6-lane highway, heading west into Hamilton, Ontario. As I drove, on my side of the highway, I saw a dog cross from the left side to the right. That area is full of trees, bushes, channels, and ravines of water that are off-shoots of Lake Ontario. When I saw the dog, it was approximately 1/2 of a kilometer ahead of me. The astonishing aspect of this dog (I’m certain it was a dog) was that its length from nose to rump (excluding its tail) covered almost the full width of the lane. 8 FEET!!! Where it was heading was back into a small valley filled with heavy forestation and a ravine. I couldn’t believe a dog could grow to that size.

I still remind my boyfriend of this occasionally. I have no witnesses."
Canada,Canada,"Saint-Georges, Quebec",-70.670352,46.1229184,,"


In June of 1995 a man sightseeing in Quebec snapped 76 photos and made 4 videos of an area known as Parc des 7 Chutes, or Seven Chutes Park, near Saint-Georges de Beauce, Quebec. As he browsed through the pictures, some-thing odd caught his eye in photo num-ber 32. There appeared to be some-thing strange standing amid the trees. When the photo was enlarged, a tall brown figure with a baboon like snout becomes clearer. Not only that, it seems to be clutching a white dog, and appears to be staring towards the photographer. He had not seen it when he took the pictures. The photographer (who wishes to remain anonymous) went back to the area and had photos taken with a man standing in the same spot for com-parison, as well as to see if there could be another explanation. Some skep-tics have suggested it is a rock formation but the subsequent area photos do not support this theory. Others claim it's simply a case of pareidolia, the phenomena of seeing faces or other distinct images in objects such as clouds, tree formations, or even a cinnamon roll. Remember the famous cinnamon roll that had the uncanny likeness to Mother Theresa of Calcut-ta? There seems to be more than that to this particular image, however. So what is the thing, and why is it holding a small dog? If it's a bigfoot, it doesn't match up with most descriptions by bigfoot eyewitnesses. This ani-mal has a snout like a dog or wolf, leading some to call it a ""Dogman"" or a werewolf.

Alaska,AK,Matanuska Valley,-149.2535787,61.5775642,10/27/1998,"10/27/1998 - My encounter took place many years ago. I never had the faintest explanation for it until a couple months ago, when I randomly stumbled across Dogman on the internet. I was in my early 20s, working swing shifts at the time and commuting about 100 miles each way, so it was usually around 2:00 in the morning by the time I got home. I saw the 'monster' (as I called it) on the northern-most section of Trunk Road in the Matanuska Valley, in Alaska. This area is roughly smack in between the towns of Palmer and Wasilla. I was only about 10 miles from home at that point, so it must have been around 2:00 a.m. Trunk Road is a narrow, 2-lane road, consisting of nothing but twists and turns. The surrounding terrain is somewhat swampy and thick with black spruce. It was late October; days before Halloween. There was no snow on the ground, but it was cold enough to be wary of ice. I was driving an '82 Subaru SW, going about 20 MPH around a curve, when my headlights caught a large, dark figure up ahead. I'm bad at judging distance; maybe 6 car lengths away. I instinctively let off the gas, coasting closer. At first I assumed it was a moose, as the area is infested with them; but no, it was standing upright. Bear, then. No, not a bear. It looked so strange... tall enough to be an uncommonly large bear, but far too slender, and it looked like it had spikes running down its neck and back. A Halloween prop? Odd but effective place for one. All those thoughts ran through my head in a fraction of a second. The car was still coasting closer and I could see more details; it was standing in profile, gazing across the road. I could clearly see its wolfish muzzle, large, upright ears; the 'spikes' on its back were in fact clumps of fur. Its spine curved in a smooth, very natural-looking way. It was standing in the ditch, inches from the pavement. Because I was focused on its upper body, I do not recall anything about its back legs or if it had a tail. I did see its front legs though; very 'doggy' looking, hanging awkwardly down and slightly toward its front, exactly as you'd expect if a dog stood upright. While it clearly had a canine look, there was still something 'off' about it that I cannot articulate. It was perfectly still, and at this point, given the proximity to Halloween, I was quite convinced it was some sort of Halloween prop, because it was clearly not any kind of existing animal. I was deeply impressed and gently stepped on the brakes, intending to stop and examine it closely. Then it turned its head towards me. In the tiny fraction of a second that it took for it to swivel its head, I knew I had made a terrible mistake. The fluidness of its movement removed any and all doubt that this was some kind of prop. It was horribly, terrifyingly alive. The pale, off-white glow of its eyeshine in the headlights destroyed any possibility of a human in a costume. I think I sat there gaping at it in shock for a few seconds, the car barely moving by now, but still inching closer. As I was almost upon it---I think it could have leaned forward and touched the car if it had wanted---I had to look up to see its face; again I'm a bad judge of such things, but I am 5'4"" and it was a hell of a lot taller than me. Tall like a polar bear standing. 7 feet? 8? I really can't say. I snapped out of my trance and slammed on the gas. The car fishtailed and I prepared myself for death-by-monster, as I was certain I'd end up in the ditch, but the tires caught the pavement and I drove like a complete maniac all the way home. I did not look back. I have only been on that section of road a few times since, never alone and never in the dark. For the next several years of driving that commute, I went 20+ miles out of the way to avoid Trunk Road. The thing never made any aggressive moves, but there was something about it that felt very... I don't know... predatory. I never saw anything remotely like it again and never heard any stories about it in the area."
Ohio,OH,Akron,-81.5190053,41.0814447,,"In January of 2010 a good friend of mine Robin V. Of Munroe Falls Paranormal Society contacted me about a rash of sightings of a werewolf type creature running out of a metro park crossing traffic. Upon talking to witnesses, All of them described it as a werewolf/Dogman. I went to the offices of the metro park district to ask about the sightings of the Dogman that have been reported in there parks. Their comment to me was “We don’t like to talk about it”. They are aware that there is something in the park, they’re just not sure what it is exactly. I left contact info in case of more sightings. About a week and a half later I received a call from a friend about a sighting from one of the park rangers. I met up with him the next morning He stated that he was getting back into his vehicle and looked off to the left and seen what appeared to be a dog on all fours, he got into his vehicle backed up and when the headlights shined on the dog it stood up and looked at him for a brief moment and walked away on just two feet. The ranger took me to the sight were he saw the creature standing, there were fresh tracks in the snow. I counted 168 tracks coming out of the deep woods to where the creature was standing and tracks from where it was standing to out of the park across the road. This is still an ongoing investigation. "
Ohio,OH,Athens County,-82.12784,39.3030308,,"Date Unknown - My girlfriend and I were driving down a remote, country road, in the early summertime, late one evening. She was the one driving. I was in the passen-ger seat. The sun was setting behind us. We had just come around a curve, when 2 does jumped out onto the road in front of us. They acted like we weren't even there. They seemed to be focused on something else. So she jammed on the brakes and brought the car to a stop. I told her, ""Man! That was close!"" That's when I looked up into the rearview mirror, to see if any more deer were coming. When I did that, in the red glow of the car's tail-lights, I saw some THING take a big step into the road, from the brush that was on the side of the road. Whatever it was, landed on its right leg, when it did that. Looking at it in the rearview mirror, I could see it from its mid-thigh, up to its stomach. In one motion, it then took another step forward and put what looked to be a hand down, on the trunk of the car, to appar-ently balance itself. When I saw that, I turned to look at my girlfriend. She was wide-eyed, her mouth was wide open, and she was white as a ghost! I could also see that her eyes were tearing up. So, I looked back, but by that time, it had already gone across the road. In an attempt to get a better look at this thing, I opened my door and got out of the car. When I looked, I could see that it was going down the embankment that was on the side of the road. Because of the brush, I could only see it from the armpits up. It was at least 7 feet tall and had very wide shoulders. Its shoulders were at least 1 1/2 times as wide as my shoul-ders, and I've got wide shoul-ders for a guy. From the last bit of daylight left, I could see that it was black or dark brown in color and had point-ed ears on top of its head, like a dog. Its ears weren't overly wide, or fuzzy. Its head was kind of dome-shaped, more or less, with flat sides. It acted like we weren't even there and seemed to remain focused on the deer. I was thinking, ""What in the world is this thing?"" It looked like some kind of Werewolf or Wolf man to me. It was WAY too big to be a person. Through that whole ordeal, I never did get a chance to see its face. In the area where we saw that thing, people have reported being paced in their vehicles, going down the road, by creatures that look like what we saw."
Ohio,OH,Canton,-81.378447,40.7989473,11/23/2016,"11/23/2016 - After digging into what I had seen on google, I had come across your name associated with the words ""dog"" and ""man"" .. along with werewolf Ohio several times. I am a sales rep for the Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania region with an office in Canton, Ohio. Being a city boy it is often intriguing and interesting to be out and about in the the country... With my job I often find myself in new places and always seeing thing I never thought I would! That is until Tuesday November 23rd ... this day I found myself following my gps down a dirt road in Lisbon Ohio, listening to the local radio station out of Akron ranting about The election.. My suddenly caught a man in a black fur coat running across a field.. first about ten feet away then in what seemed a flash he was halfway across it before I had time to realize this was NOT normal... I slammed on the brakes and grabbed my phone to take a photo but I hadn't enough time to fire off a good shot.. (the picture attached is what I got) This thing was at least 7ft tall and fast as HELL! Black, and I noticed what I later thought must have been long pearly white teeth in a row as it ran.. I do remember two distinct ears high on it head. It was for SURE on two legs but appeared to be a giant ... dog/man of sorts"
Ohio,OH,Clermont County,-84.1857115,39.0928449,,"May 2016 - A male employee (approx. age 62) of a water treatment facility on the east side of Cincinnati was making a nightly round to drive to a particular tank and open a valve. Driving down a rural road dotted with houses, he sees on his right something standing in front of a garage, lit by a bright overhead light. He put his truck in reverse and backed up to get a better look, stopping at the foot of the driveway.  The creature was standing about where the SUV is parked on the right. Image on the right shows the light pole, directly across from the basketball hoop. I was told there is another light that brightly illuminates up near the garage door, but I could not see it from my vantage point. The driveway is about 50 ft. long. These images were shot from inside a car, just like the witness would have seen. I blotted out the house and license plate numbers for privacy of the residents, who were not interviewed. I wonder if they have any idea what lurks around their house at night.The witness describes a bizarre creature he estimates to be about the size of a man. It was covered in brown leathery skin, but had regular animal hair on the head, neck and chest. He describes a canine head with a long muzzle and pointed ears on top. He reports that the legs were dog-like, but the arms appeared man-like. Interestingly, the creature stood in an unusual pose, likening it to this type of yoga position called intense side stretch.The witness said that instead of forming a V shape as in the woman pictured, the creature’s legs formed more of a horseshoe shape. If they were canine type legs, one can easily see where this would make sense. The creature’s arms hung down in front, but I don’t know if it was touching the ground or its own foot or what. 
Eerily, the creature did not move, but eyed the witness with just one eye, keeping its head in profile. The witness reports a sort of sneer on the creature’s face, as if to say, “You see me, don’t you?” He said the overall feeling about this creature was that it was “bad news”. 
He and the creature stared at each other for about a minute, with the creature remaining in place just looking at him. At length, the witness drove off to attend to his duty up the road. When he returned about 8 minutes later, the creature was gone.  I was taken to the water tank employees must attend every morning at 4 am. As the crow flies, this tank is only about a hundred yards from where the sighting took place. This is where the witness was headed at the time of the sighting. The employee comes out here alone each morning at 4 am, drives up to the locked gate and opens it, then walks into the enclosure and opens a valve on this tank. On the right side of the driveway is a dense hedge of trees and honeysuckle. On the other side of that hedge is a small field with outbuilding and parking lot, then the road and on the opposite side of it, the house where the sighting took place. On the right hand side of the tower is mostly farmland. One is pretty alone in the dark at this tank. My friend noted that going into the gate to the tank isn’t bad, but coming back your headlights are in your face and it’s hard to see. 
For some time now, prior to the sighting, the witness has been expressing his uneasiness coming to this particular location. He said he always feels like something is watching him. I have been assured that this witness is anything but a coward and is actually a bit of a “bad ass” type. But he has long been uncomfortable coming here in the dark. 
The locations of this tank, the water treatment facility and the sighting are very near a state park and a wildlife area, a lake, a large creek and railroad tracks. 
Unfortunately, I’ve yet to get permission from the witness for a direct interview, but I’m still holding out hope. This information comes from my friend, who works with the witness.  "
Ohio,OH,Clinton County,-83.8473015,39.4067432,7/21/2016,"7/21/2016 - I was driving my girlfriend home from work. Both of us lived in a suburb of our small town, so the drive from her workplace is relatively short. The only off thing about our encounter was the fact we saw it in a suburb, as opposed to the wooded or rural areas, like other encounters. The moon was full, so we had a lot of light to see, but there were many mature trees in the yards of the houses surrounding the road we were driving on. All we saw was a large black blur, moving very fast. Almost as fast as a greyhound, at full speed. The length of the blur made me estimate it to be 6 to 7 feet. Both of us were shaken by the experience and headed home immediately. When we got home, my girlfriend and I recanted our experience with her family, who laughed at us for telling them we had seen such a thing. They brushed it off as a tall tale and went on with their nightly activities. 
 
My girlfriend's two younger siblings were planning on playing a game called Manhunt. It's pretty much just like hide and seek. When the two of them headed out, not even two minutes after they walked out the door, they both bolted in, clearly upset and shaken. They both said they saw exactly what my girlfriend and I saw, but when they saw it, it was walking on its hind legs, under a street lamp. Because of that, they got a clear view of it. They said it was dog-like and was walking on its hind legs, on the street. After hearing that, we all as a group of witnesses, headed out in my car, to search for the beast and to warn the other kids playing Manhunt about the beast. My girlfriend's siblings have stopped playing Manhunt after their experience and now that we all have a name to what we saw, we are all more shaken wondering if it will be back"
Ohio,OH,Fairfield County,-82.6483442,39.830506,5/19/2004,"5/19/2004 - One night, I was out in the woods hunting, around 1:00 AM and found this weirdly mangled deer carcass, near a tree. About 1 hour and 50 minutes later, I was walking back to my truck, when I saw that it was shaking violently, so I readied my rifle. I then saw that it was a bear-like creature shaking my truck. It stood up on its hind legs and growled at me, before running off, into the woods.

When I got a look at the creature, it had long arms and its claws were around 3 inches long. It had pointed ears, like a German Shepherd, muscly shoulders and legs, and a wolf-like snout, with a short, nub tail."
Ohio,OH,Franklin County,-82.9931607,40.0154745,,"I was 11, I was staying up all night, playing video games, when I heard something outside, in the bushes. I was paranoid and the blinds were wide open, so I looked outside and saw reddish, orange eyes. I could also barely make out a face, with a snout. I fell back in fear and heard a howl outside and then footsteps getting further away when I got back up. 2 minutes later, it was gone.

Ohio,OH,Germantown,-84.3693882,39.6261682,,"Myself along with four other guys decided to go park on Anthony Rd, and walk out to the middle of a field to drink some beer. We lived in a small town and not much to do (keep in mind however that we hadn’t yet started drinking and even if we had I don’t think it would have caused a group hallucination).
The reason we had guns was due to an incident prior to this were my female cousin and her friends, whom were all about five years younger than us came back to my aunts house one night really scared and said that they were driving down Anthony Rd, and a guy was lying in the middle of the road, so they had to stop the car, It’s a narrow road so they couldn’t turn around and so they put the car in reverse to back up. Just then the guy in the road jumped up and started chasing the car, and people came out of the cornfields and tried to open the car doors and trying to stop the car. They took off in drive and came back to the house and told us what happened. Hence the presence of guns the night of our encounter.
 
The night we had our encounter was a very bright night. A full moon (or near full), shone down on some pretty thick fog that was about shin high, so visibility was quite high. We drove up and down the road 1 time just to make sure no cops were parked on the road anywhere, then we spotted the field we wanted to go into. It was really cool looking with the fog laying heavy on the ground and the moon bouncing off of it giving a really cool glow effect. We parked the cars (two cars), and began to venture into the field at the area tractors would enter. We walked about maybe twenty or thirty yards in and stopped to listen for cars coming, and also to just listen to the woods to make sure no one else was around.
 
One of us noticed something large and dark along the wood line to our right about 150 yards out into the field. We all stopped talking and watched it for a few minutes trying to determine what it was ( a tree stump, large rock, bush ect). After a few minutes we decided it was just a big bush and stopped paying attention to it and walked further into the field. After going into the field a little more one of us noticed the object wasn’t there were we had seen it before. We began to scan the area to see where it went and then we noticed something running from right to left across the field in front of us. It looked to be about three feet above the fog line (if not four feet). So that would make it bigger than any dog. The mechanics of how it ran reminded me of a cheetah or greyhound dog, reaching out with long forelimbs to grab the ground and then hurling its hind haunches under itself to spring forward yet again. It’s silhouette looked like a wild boar or hyena (it had the stereotypical large hump on its upper back). It ran really really fast to the center of the field and then turned directly towards us. I’ve never seen anything able to cut a different direction as fast as this thing did, especially considering how fast it was traveling. At first we thought it had stopped running, but then after a second we were able to tell it was now coming straight at us. We were all asking/commenting with each other trying to reason what it was (dog, cougar, bear, ect). As it continued it’s charge we raised guns at it. I had a shotgun and two of the other guys had pistols. When we raised our guns it began to zig zag. I remember thinking that it knew what guns were. I remember saying (or one of us said), that thing knows we are pointing guns at it. I think that’s when we got creeped out enough to run for the cars. MY buddy ( the facebook guy) said he didn’t shoot because he couldn’t identify the target. I personally (and am not ashamed to say) think it is because we all got scared because we knew it wasn’t any known animal. It was moving so fast that I thought if I miss, or if my first shot doesn’t stop it, I wont get a second shot. Shotguns are only good within certain distances and I didn’t want it getting that close to me. As we were running away my friend at the time fell into a groundhog hole so I had to run back and help him up so we could get to the cars.
 
Given how fast it was running, I don’t think it was really trying to catch us or it would have. When we got to the cars and took off, I recall looking out the side window and this thing was chasing the cars. Once we got over the little bridge on Anthony onto Manning road we were able to get up more speed. I don’t think it ever came out of the field or crossed the bridge however. It’s as if it just wanted to chase us off.
 
It never stood up on two legs and I didn’t notice any eyeshine (I think it may have been too far away when it started its charge to see the eyes). I can tell you that it was bigger than any dog and much much faster. It was able to zig zag really fast, like a rabbit. It was very jerky in it’s side to side movement. Almost twitchy I’d say. I got the feeling that it was so quick and agile that I might not be able to get a bead on it to get good hits on it with the shotgun. As we were pulling away in the car is probably when I got the best look at it. It had odd body mechanics as it ran. It reminded me of a cheetah and I could tell the forelimbs were longer than the hind limbs. I couldn’t see a tail or the shape of the ears however."
Ohio,OH,Lewisburg,-84.5396736,39.8461629,,"2017 - My girlfriend and I had a sighting along Rt 40, just north of Brookville. The sun was up still, a little before sunset, thin high clouds, so plenty of light. I was driving, and she was looking at me as we were going west on 40, just talking, when I see her eyes go wide, looking past me through my window; and she practically screams ""What the hell is that!?"" and points across the field we're traveling parallel to. I look to my left, and see something huge and black, with a massive upper body running like a bat out of hell along the edge of the woods.
She watched it for a good 30 seconds, running along the edge of the woods until we lost sight of it when we passed a house close to the road. She kept going on about it half panicked and excited until we got home (about 3-4 minutes to the house from the point of the sighting).
Finally, we get home and I asked her what she saw exactly, and she said it was a big black thing that was running faster than any deer or human could move, big upper body, couldn't see any major detail due to distance across the field. she said ""It was one of those things, wasn't it?!"" I introduced her to the NADP site after the encounter, but I had asked her about seeing anything strange up that way in the past, animals acting oddly, coming up missing, etc. which she had confirmed happening over time"

June 2017 - Last week my son, Kaden, was in Ohio and saw both a sasquatch and a Dogman on our uncle's families property, to be exact, it was his brothers. The brother, Rocky, has been hearing howls coming from the woods and has shot into them several times. My sons cousin, Jersey, also saw a Dogman walking towards Rockys house and they saw shadows at the family cemetery. I'm trying to get permission from them to investigate. Kaden says when hes deer hunting he hears walking, knocks, grunts and growls. A year or two ago, something scared the Alpacas or Llamas our aunt had, on her part of the property, and when the one was found, it was torn apart--they said a bear did it, I believe otherwise from what I was told. He did send me this picture of a tree."

Too close to home
Dogman Sighting details::
My mother just told me that a few days ago on her way to work (5am), she saw red Red eyeshine in the corner of her eye from her headlights. She tried to look at what had caused it, but what she saw made her shiver. The creature was about my father's height (6 ft or more), and had turned towards the cornfield after looking at my mother's vehicle from the side of the road. As she passed it all she could see was the backend. She described it as a naked man with dark gray or black wolf hair, no tail. After she passed she kept watching it and saw it turn it's head to watch her, but it did not turn its body like a Bigfoot would, its body was still. She said she saw incredible intelligence but also felt evil. A few months prior on my way home from work (11:30pm) I saw red eyeshine and then a large creature speed across the road about 3-4000 yards in front of me. It had black fur, a long muzzle with a large head, broad shoulders with what seemed almost like a mane around it, large and long front and back legs at a strange angle, no tail. When it happened the first thing that popped into my head was an impossible wolf and wild boar mix. At the time I didn't know about Dogman but after learning about him, that's what that creature had to be. This all happened in Morrow county Ohio. Another sighting happened last week outside of Mt. Vernon, Knox county Ohio about 35-45 miles from our house.

Ohio,OH,Scioto County,-82.9931607,38.861065,3/10/2005,"3/10/2005 - Okay; this took a lot of courage because I’ve been ridiculed so much, for what happened to me. My grandfather owned a cabin. I’m not disclosing the location of it, due to the fact that I don’t want anything to happen to anyone. Anyway; my grandfather’s cabin was his way of getting the family together for the holidays, so he could have a nice Sunday dinner with all of us.

One day, all of a sudden, that all stopped abruptly. He wouldn’t allow anyone, but himself, to visit the cabin we all looked forward to going to and cherished. For years, I would ask him why he was doing that. He never told me why, but when he passed, he left the place to me. I inherited the cabin of my childhood and was ecstatic about that. It was soon after that, I realized why he did what he did. I would go out and walk the woods, on game trails, which are everywhere. I know these woods like I know my own home, so I never had any reason to fear them. It was on one of these walks that I encountered what people call “Dogmen.”

I was walking, just like any other time. Nothing was different. It was then, on one of the game trails, I noticed an offshoot, small trail that went only 6 to 7 feet back. I could see that something had bedded down there. I thought it was a deer. I then walked in the bedded area. I soon realized that this was an ambush point for whatever made this bedded area and it was massive! My arm hairs stood erect and a chill literally ran down my spine! I felt as if I was being watched from different vantage points. Since it was nighttime, I had a tracking flashlight and my sidearm. The latter of which I drew and kept at the ready. I genuinely feared for my life at this point. All of a sudden, an ungodly growl was made to my right, about 10 to 15 yards from me (very close indeed). I pissed myself. It was so terrifying! I didn’t immediately run, fearing that whatever it was might take me as threatening. I turned and started heading back on the main trail and when I was about 5 minutes from the back door of my cabin, this thing let out a howl that I swear felt like it went right through my body! I then proceeded to run. As soon as I did, this thing was chasing me. For every 5 steps I took, this thing was taking 1. That’s how fast this Dogman was! I heard the sounds of branches being ripped off trees and I could have sworn I felt the vibrations of it running after me. I barely made it to my cabin and slammed the door, locking the 2 deadbolts and chain lock. I then turned on my spotlight and shined it into the tree line. There were 3 sets of eyes in the tree line that shined vivid yellow, with enormous, black pupils! I felt as if the thing could read my mind, but I’m not sure it could. All I know is that I’m alive and have since heard them many times, but I don’t take night hikes anymore and haven’t for years."

Ohio,OH,Trumbull County,-80.7214417,41.3064984,12/26/2016,"12/26/2016 - I saw something on Monday night that still has me totally shaken to my very core. I have always loved nature… I love the woods, I love hiking and camping, fishing, I’m really into mycology so I’m out looking for mushrooms and various types of fungus whenever I get a chance. The weather was absolutely beautiful on Monday for this time of year, so towards evening time, I decided to round up some of my walleye gear and head down to an old train trestle crossing the Mahoning river in Niles, Ohio. I had parked my car about a mile and a half from the trestle so I could walk the tracks and hit a few other spots along the river on my way down there. By the time I reached the trestle, it was pretty much dark. I was wearing a headlamp at the time so I had a depending light source. At this location, there is a lake directly across the river, which the two are connected by a small overhead dam. I was there for 15 min when all of the sudden, this overwhelming feeling of dread came over me. I switched my headlamp on to turn around to start back up the river bank, and right behind a big sycamore tree, I saw what looked to be a VERY LARGE ANIMAL, kind of kneeling beside/behind it. As I locked my eyes on it, I completely froze. I knew I was definitely seeing something there, but my mind couldn’t process it. What I was looking at didn’t make any fucking sense. The thing that I kept saying to myself was, “Animals aren’t supposed to look like that.” Right as I’m thinking this, it’s as if this thing read my mind, STOOD UP, and made itself perfectly visible in the most pretentious way. It almost had this vibe like, “Yeah, now you see me, you know I’m real, I definitely exist… What are you gonna do about it?” And as soon as it happened, it kind of hunched over and made its way into the brush. I was out of there LIKE A FLASH. As soon as my feet hit the tracks, I ran and ran the entire way back to my car, without stopping. By the time I reached my car, I couldn’t breathe. Both my legs were locked up. I was vomiting and somewhere in between the encounter and running away, I had pissed myself. It’s early Friday morning now, and I think I’ve only slept for about 6 or 7 hours altogether. I’ve been constantly searching YouTube and all kinds of stuff, listening to eyewitness accounts, and it sounds like these things are encountered quite often. I’ve heard of the “Dogman” before but never really took it seriously. Before the night of this encounter, I would always picture a dogman to look like some little skittish, coyote looking creature. Man… I love the woods and I love nature. The woods for me was always a safe haven I could venture into, to escape stress. Stress at work, bills, relationship problems… I could always take a nice long hike, go fishing or foraging and come home feeling 75% better. Now, I feel like I was threatened and kicked out if my second home. The only thing I can keep thinking is, these things aren’t supposed to exist. I feel like a terrified little kid who just came face to face with the dreaded “monster in the closet”. You know, the monster you parents told you, no wait, ASSURED YOU, wasn’t real and couldn’t hurt you. People need to be made aware of these things. They are as REAL as it gets and they are dangerous. Thinking back to what this thing looked like and how it was built, these things are perfectly adapted killing machines. The way the arms and legs looked, it looked like it was perfectly adapted to walk on all fours as well as on two legs, it was sooo quiet and fluent with its movements also. It’s not like in the movies where the monster comes charging out of the woods, growling and snarling, these things are are masters of camouflage and they utilize the darkness perfectly. I didn’t notice a smell from it, probably because the wind was on my back at the time, but it sure smelled me. Its nose was up in the air the whole time of our encounter, just sniffing away. This experience has torn a huge hole in me. Every time I eat, I get nauseous, I can’t sleep for more than 20 min. at a time, and every time I close my eyes, that thing is all I can see. I’m trying not to dwell in the fear, I’m trying to accept what I saw and what had happened, but it’s hard. I’m really glad I found this group and found a few things on YouTube, so I know I’m not alone."
Michigan,MI,Oceana County,-86.2895052,43.643476,,"My encounter happened in February 2009. In November 2008, I broke my arm and was basically stranded at home. I was unable to drive or work and was going stark, raving mad with boredom. My best friend would drive the 35 miles north from Muskegon, to pick me up in Shelby; just to take me back to Muskegon, for a visit at her home. She’d take me to dinner or out to see a movie, only to deliver me home to Shelby, after whichever activity. It was truly a selfless act of love.

One night, she was driving me home. It was very late, well after 11 pm. We were on US-31 Northbound, around the Rothbury area of Oceana County, on the expressway. Being February, in Michigan, the roads were naturally snowy, with scattered patches of ice and bare pavement. There was a small pickup truck in front of us, about 5 car lengths ahead of her car, when all of a sudden, we saw something on 2 legs dart out from the left, just in front of an overpass. It ran across the 2 lane highway and hit the back of the small pickup in the rear quarter-panel, causing the pickup to fishtail. Luckily, the driver of the small pickup regained control but they didn’t stop to see what collided with their truck. If anything, it seemed to pick-up speed and get the heck out of there. My friend and I watched in utter astonishment as the creature finished running to the right and disappeared into the weeds and trees along the highway. It didn’t even break stride after it hit the truck. We looked at one another, sat in silence for a moment, and then I said, “Did you see….?” She said, “Yea. I saw it….”

We finished the ride to my house in silence; both lost in our thoughts. It looked like a giant dog or wolf. It was on its hind legs; not all 4’s and it was at least 7 feet tall. It had pointed ears, a kind of mane around its neck ( much like a lion’s mane), was dark in color, and its hind legs looked like a dog’s, which was even more pronounced, as it was running only on its hind legs. It’s front legs were freely swinging as it ran and it seemed to have its mouth slightly open. It had an elongated face, very much like a collie face and a long nose protruding from its face. Its face was covered by longish hair. The entire creature seemed to be covered in long hair but I can’t recall if it had a tail. Something tells me it did but I can’t recall for certain, so I don’t want to say it did, when in fact, I’m not sure. We thought perhaps it may have been one of the Michigan Dogmen that are said to be in our area. Being a former Native American area, we have heard the stories but never met anyone that had a first-hand encounter. It was always someone who knew someone who knew someone who saw something. But now, my best friend and I definitely saw it. We had a first-hand experience. Our encounter was brief and over in a matter of mere moments but it was front and center of us and we saw it clear as a bell."
Michigan,MI,Oceana County,-86.2895052,43.643476,,"January 2016 - I encountered a bipedal wolf-like creature, here in western Michigan and it's got me spooked. I was out shoveling snow, as it's common here in my state. My encounter happened in a place just south of Rothbury, Michigan. I decided to take a walk in my family's woods, one day. That's when my life changed forever! My family owns 270 acres of land, here in the town/city of Montague, Mi. I ventured out into those woods, as I've done many times (100's of them). The walk started as any one would. I started to follow the creek south, to check for deer stands, on our property. The walk went as planned, until I got about 300 yards south of the house. I stopped, to have a cigarette. My eyes started to wander, as I scoped for deer or coyote. As I gazed back and forth, I noticed this figure and froze. I literally froze! This thing made eye contact with me and then stood up. It was hairy, had very broad shoulders, and amber colored eyes. It let out a growl unlike any other I've heard. This wolf, as I call it, made two leaps and was gone. The most surprising thing about this encounter was how silent the woods were, up to when I had my encounter. So that you know, your episode 80 is what made me want to talk about this."
Michigan,MI,Reed City,-85.5100498,43.8750174,,I was going to work in september 1995 and saw a 7 foot tall 375 lb creture run across us 10 near reed city michigan since then ive researched on my own and had another sighting..for more details of my encounters listen to dogman encounters episode 5..Ive since started 2 facebook groups International Dogman And Bigfoot research group and Dogman Believers only..dogman is real.
Michigan,MI,Ironwood,-90.1710081,46.4546698,,"My sighting occurred sometime in the winter of 1992, when I was 10 years old. I have always been an insomniac and would often be up in the middle of the night- This was the case on the night in question. I was in my bedroom looking out the window on the ground-floor of my childhood home. I looked across the street and my eyes landing on something that paralyzed me me with fascination. Leaning against the big tree in my neighbor's yard was a massive gray, bipedal dog or wolf with huge muscular arms sniffing the air. He was just standing there, sniffing the air. The image has been burned into my mind ever since. The way the steam of his breath swirled out of his nose as he craned his neck from side to side, the way the snow stuck to his gray bristling fur, and the way his ears twitched. At first I told myself that it was just a big dog leaning on a tree, I couldn't accept what my brain was screaming to me. There was this crazy feeling I had, I don't know how to explain it, I still feel it when I think or talk about it. It deeply disturbed me and I swear it knew I was watching it through the edge of my curtain. I don't know how I know that, I just do. It never looked directly at me, it had sort of glanced in the direction of my house, but I swear it knew I was watching. It didn't seem to mind. It seemed to be pleased with the the strange mixture of sinking fear, confusion, denial and awe that I was experiencing. Again, I don't know how I know that, I just do. What happened next dispelled all my denial. It sort of swung itself off the tree and instead of dropping down to all fours as one would expect of a huge dog, it remained standing on it's two legs, slightly hunched, and began to walk through the deep snow in the most unnatural way. I don't even know how to describe it other than ""unnatural"". It was just so wrong. The way it walked, for some reason was the most terrifying aspect of this whole encounter to me. It just sort of lumbered off behind the houses across the street and out of sight. I didn't speak of this encounter for nearly 20 years after it happened. I had never heard anyone else speak of it locally in Ironwood, or anywhere else for that matter, and just chalked it up to another one of the absolutely insane things I have seen in my life that I never speak of and make me question my sanity. Then one night, while listening to Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis, he was talking about the ""Michigan Dogman"". My head almost exploded, I couldn't believe it! Other people had seen this thing?! I finally broke my silence and told my wife about it. IT wa ssort of an epiphany I had in that moment. I know longer kept my strange experiences to myself anymore. I told everyone who I felt would be even slightly receptive to the idea of the paranormal about them. In my mind, I imagined how long I kept these strange secrets to myself for fear of being seen as a lunatic and how even I thought I was probably insane, and wondered how many other people are out there walking around with similar experiences and similar self-doubt, just waiting for someone to come along and share the strange tale that allows them to give themselves permission to speak freely about the things they have kept locked inside as I had. It's shocking how many people, once you tell them a story like this, have a story of some high strangeness of their own. I am so happy that this site exists, and people like you are out there telling these strange stories and giving people the opening they need to re-examine the strangeness of their lives and the world in which they live them."
Michigan,MI,Montague,-86.357013,43.4166772,,"Hello, I live here in rural west Michigan in the town of Montague. It is located in northern Muskegon county. I have had 3 different encounters with a wolf like creature. The first encounter took place on or about February 2, 2016 4:38 am. I was shoveling the driveway as it was snowing heavily and needed it cleared for the propane delivery. There are woods all around, but this encounter took place in the woods to the south. As I was about half way done with the shoveling when I heard a splash in the crick, I thought it was a deer I had spooked. So I stopped and started to scan the woods and crick, then all of a sudden this huge and I mean huge wolf like creature leapt into the air and took of with a super sonic burst of speed to the west. It crossed the road and continued west. I heard branches snapping right and left. I stood there absolutely frozen. In total shock and amazement at what I had just seen. The second encounter took place on April 11, 2016 3:15 pm. I was a bit shaken up by the first encounter that this was my first trip back into the woods since. I was walking the property, which consists of about 30 acres of mainly hardwood and creek bottom. I was crossing the crick headed east when I caught something out of the corner of my eye to the south. I was about 30 to 35 yards from what I thought was a black bear. It was tearing profusely at the West Bank of the crick. Then it stood up and I froze. It turned around and stood up on its hind legs, This was at least 71/2 feet tall, I was in the middle of the crick and was absolutely shitting myself. I didn't want to run out of fear it would give chase, and the firearm I had brought didn't stand a chance against this thing. Then all of a sudden it put its nose straight up into the air, and sniffed a couple of times. It looked immediately to the East, looked back at me and with two huge strides took off into the thicket headed east. After it cleared the thicket it jumped into the trees and was leaping from tree top to tree top. and this one had all black fur, that was matted and smelled horrendous. Like rotten guts and sour fruit. The first wolf like creature I saw was a grayish color with a little white in it. They both had pointed ears and a snout, a number of jagged looking teeth, and tails. The second one had much longer claws than the first one did. The third and final encounter came May 2, 2016 9:20 pm. I was collecting some kindling from the wood line south of the house. I had just about finished when I heard a loud snap. I stopped and listened for any movement. I'm on the wood line, not in the woods, I'm to frightened to step foot in them. Then I heard rustling sounds and another snap, this one sounded like a bone, not a branch. The sounds intensify so I click on my flash light. I started to scan the distance, as I get about half way I see glistening eyes yellow in color about 25 yards in front of me. I kept my light on it. It snarled and let out this deep growling sound that literally shook me. I started to back up and again this thing stood up and bent over to pick something up. I kept the light on it. It picked up what is was after, turned around and looked at me like I had interrupted something it was doing, and just walked off into the woods to the south and disappeared. The next day I have my cousin walk out with me to were the creature stood. What we found was the hide, and only the hide of a whitetail deer. I truly believe that the creature I saw was responsible for this. It was skinned like something just gThe creature I saw reminds me of a werewolf. In my 3 encounters the one thing that freaks me out is how eerily silent it got before my encounters. I have since found out that the property has many Indian burial grounds on it. Heavily wooded, with a fresh water crick running through entire property. I used to walk the woods 4 times a week, and since my encounter I have a very hard time walking the wood line let alone the woods themself."
Michigan,MI,Manistee County,-86.3242225,44.2444704,,"I never saw it, but in 1975, I was newly married, about 21 years old, and had a small baby. My sister, who was a teenager, was visiting us. My husband, my sister, and I had all gone to our bedrooms, to settle down and go to sleep. I would say it was around 11 or 12, at night. We were just starting to relax and get sleepy, when out of nowhere, there was this HORRIBLE, LOUD howl/yell. I mean, it was so loud, it made my chest vibrate and my ears hurt. The sound was not human, but had a gutteral human-like sound, mixed with what sounded like a wolf. We were living in a mobile home at the time and it howled just outside our back door, in the hallway, near our bedroom. We jumped out of bed, looked at each other, and both said at the same time, ""What the hell was that?"" My husband was 10 years older than I was and was an avid hunter. He wasn't the kind of guy to scare easily. His face drained of color. My sister came running down the hallway, white as a ghost, and said, ""What was THAT?"" I told her I didn't know. My husband said he was getting his rifle and grabbed it out of the closet. He opened up the back door and yelled out into the wind, ""You better get the $%^$ out of here, or I will blow your head off!"" He listened a moment before I yelled at him to please shut the door. He did and we never heard anymore after that. Needless to say, we stayed up all night, afraid to go to sleep. I have never forgotten that howl. There is no way it was a dog or coyotes (I have heard both howl). It wasn't a guy joking around, either. It was so loud, there is no way a human could have made that sound. I Love your show and am glad to hear I am not the only one who has heard something like this. "

Report Title:
Bald Mountain Michigan werewolf house
Dogman Sighting details::
During the years between 1965 to 1974 I lived in Pontiac Mich. I was a teenager at that time many local teens and teens from other surrounding area would go to a area called Bald Mountain. On this property there was a block house with bars on all the windows and steel door. On the door wolf bane was painted local legend was that a man was found in the house with his throat ripped out and that he thought there was a werewolf living in the surrounding woods. I have tried to researching this story but can't find anything I have often wondered if this was the dog man having spent many weekends at this house and having many strange experiences do you have anyone telling you stories about this house sadly the area was blocked off by police to keep people from getting in any help you can give me about area would be appreciated. Thank YOU

Michigan,MI,Saginaw County,-84.0167423,43.4044253,,"2009 - I was arriving home, to my apartment, at 11:45 PM, when I felt a presence by the wood line. I saw something looking at me and then finally, I saw these two eyes. It seemed like it was stalking me. I could only see eyes and the shape of its head. I really couldn’t see its body but instantly, I felt fear and went inside my apartment. When I went inside, I started looking through the blinds, just a little bit. I didn’t want to move the blinds that much because I knew he knew where I was, so I didn’t want to move the window blinds. Then, I saw it heading my way. This beast looked like a bodybuilder, with a wolf or dog-like head. Because of its silhouette, this thing must have been 7 to 8 feet tall. It stopped, just for a second, right in front of my window, then it left.
I’ve never feared for my life like I did that night."
Michigan,MI,Washtenaw County,-83.8473015,42.3076493,,"Mid-September 2005, July 20th, 2015, and February 21st, 2017 - I have had 3 different encounters with 3 different creatures. I know what I saw. When I was younger, I saw what looked like a wolf or big German Shepherd, on its hind legs, running through a very thick patch of woods. It only happened for a second but I remember the long muzzle and pointed ears distinctly.

The second encounter was more exciting. It was late at night, after a small barbecue/party, at my uncle’s farm, miles north of Ann Arbor. I was coming out of the barn to get some more food when I heard sticks breaking in the tree line to my right. My first impression was that one of the dogs got outside. So, I went to go see if that was the case. I walked towards the sound and remember hearing the creature flinch because the movement stopped as I approached. I called out for the golden retriever and peered into the trees. The barn had spotlights facing the house and with the white paint job on it, they created a glow that allowed me to see better. About 7 feet off the ground, a long muzzle poked through the trees. Followed by the full-figure of this creature. It was only 20 feet away from me, so I got the full picture. It was tall and lean but very muscular. It had a distinct brown pelt on its body, with blackish fur on its shoulders. It had huge paws for feet, but its hands looked like they had 5 fingers, so they resembled long human hands, except for the fur and claws on them. Its head was the scariest. This thing had a huge set of canines. It looked like it was snarling, but I believe it was trying to smile. I couldn’t make out exactly what its eye color was because of how dark it was, but they pierced into my soul! As the creature came into full view, I remember saying out loud to myself, “Werewolf!” I backed up slowly and the creature stood there, like a proud man standing over a deer he had hunted. It watched me for about 30 seconds, but it felt like 30 minutes. That’s when my father, uncle, cousin, and grandfather all came out of the barn. When I tell you this thing ran, I mean it RAN! It turned around, dropped to all 4’s, and leaped into the forest, making only a slight noise. I told my cousin about it but he didn’t believe me. I knew my father wouldn’t believe me because he doesn’t believe in anything.

4 days ago, in my own backyard, the same type of creature knocked on my window. My curtains were drawn, to give me a view of the woods. I live in the middle of a patch of woods, near a fire road. I wasn’t asleep yet and couldn’t describe what was wrong, but I felt uneasy. I was trying to sleep when I heard a slight scrape at the house wall, below my window. My window is 8 feet off the ground. When I sat up in bed, to see what was going on, I saw the head of what I can only describe as a Werewolf in my window, which is only 10 feet from my bed. I cursed, jumped up, turned on the light and grabbed the survival machete I had in my closet. I turned to see if it was still there and it had disappeared. The next day I went out to see if I could find any tracks or anything that might prove what I saw, but never found a thing. For about a day, I was unsure of myself. Then I heard about your radio show and decided that it I should tell someone who can get the word out about it"
Minnesota,MN,Aitkin County,-93.4536692,46.6185433,,"January 2015 - I’m a city girl, so I don’t know a thing about tracks. Last winter, I was at the cabin and saw prints, in the snow, next to the small creek, near the frozen pond. The prints were a big circle, with 3, smaller circles, above the big circle. I wear a size 7 shoe, but wear a size 8 boot, to provide room, for extra socks. The print was bigger than my boot, which measures 11 inches long. I went home and looked on the internet, to see what kind of print it was. After doing that, I decided it must have been a wolf. After I heard about Dogman, a month or so ago, I checked the Bemidji Wolf Center’s website and discovered that wolf prints only get to be about 5.5 inches long. Since I don’t know anything about tracks, I couldn’t tell if it was a 4 or 2 legged creature, that had left the track. Of course, at the time, the 2 legged possibility was the furthest thing from my mind. I told my friend about the tracks and that I thought they might have been Dogman tracks. Although he was my friend, he said he didn’t believe in Dogman. He did say that a guy we went to high school with, back in the 80‘s, with whom my friend played music, at the time, said he had seen the devil, in the woods, when he was up north, hunting. He said it had red eyes, stood on 2 legs, had a dog head, was huge, and stared at him and then jumped across the gulley he was in like it was nothing.

One thing I forgot to mention is that I had a tough little lhasa apso with me when I saw those tracks. He is usually a fearless dog, but he would not leave my side all that weekend. I couldn’t even get him to go outside the cabin alone, to go to the bathroom. Also, my 300 lb brother is afraid of the cabin and won’t go up there alone. He doesn’t believe in Dogman or Bigfoot, but something about the place creeps him out. I’ve gone up there alone but rarely go outside, after dark. Once in a while, I find myself finishing up in the sauna, after dark and rush back to the cabin, which is about 100 yards away. I use an indoor bucket, instead of the outhouse, in the winter, when the water is turned off. I’m going to make sure that I put curtains up, on all the windows, now that I’ve heard your shows."
Minnesota,MN,Otter Tail County,-95.8935983,46.5189435,,"I'll start off by saying that I have never believed in any of these sort of creatures, but I saw something in early 2009 that really disturbed me and is making me change my mind. I was not under the influence of any drugs, and I have better than average eyesight, and the lighting was nearing sunset, but I was still able to see clearly. So, I'll get this underway and explain my story and maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I live in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, which is in west central Minnesota, about an hour drive from Fargo, North Dakota. My mother-in-law lives out in the country, about 3-4 miles out of Fergus Falls, and I was staying there while my wife and her mother went shopping in town. They called me, and asked if i wanted to go to a 7PM movie. So, I left the house at about 6:30pm-6:45pm to meet them at the theater. About 2 miles from their house on a country road known as the Wendel Road, along the Mistinka River, I saw 3 white tail deer. 2 of the deer were rather small, probably just yearlings and a larger doe, who I assumed was their mother. Me being an avid hunter, lover of wildlife, and future Wildlife Biologist, stopped to look at the deer. I should also mention that I hunt in the area and have spent my whole life in the Fergus Falls area. The deer were following a small creek bed, which is in fact the Mistinka River, so there were hardly any trees, except for one. Maybe, because I didn't see it there, because of the tree, but I just noticed something crouching behind the tree on my side of the road, looking at the deer, and to my belief, hunting them. It just sat there, looking at the deer, taking no notice of me, even though I was in my truck, no more than 40 yards away, with a clear view, with nothing obstructing my view of it. It had one ""hand"" on the tree that it was bracing itself with. What struck me as shocking was the fact that it seemed to be a 2-legged creature, and not a 4-legged one. Its ""hands"" appeared to have opposable thumbs and were rather slender and long, very unlike a wolf. The creature looked as though if it stood upright, it would be over 7 feet tall, with a protruding muzzle, broad shoulders, a slender waist, thick, muscular thighs, and being as there was snow on the ground, I couldn't see the feet. He was deep, dark brown in color throughout the body. After several seconds of looking at the creature in shock, the deer ran off. Then, something amazing happened. It looked right at me... As though blaming me for losing his meal. He just sat there, looking at me, and blinking, but not moving. This scared the crap out of me, so I hit the gas pedal and drove off. It was very dark after the movie, so I didn't much feel like trudging through the 3.5 feet of snow, with the possibility of a monster lurking in the area, who is currently looking for a meal that I scared off. So, at about 10am, I went back there and walked down to the tree. Under the tree, there was no snow, so there were no tracks that I could see, but leading up to the tree, there were 3 tracks leading in from my grandmother-in-law's field, which was hard, black dirt, and if you know what a Minnesota field looks like in late winter/early spring, you can't make anything out of the dirt. The tracks I did find were only about 6-7 inches in length, but were clearly K9 prints, with the exception of 4 toe-looking marks in the snow."
Minnesota,MN,St. Louis County,-92.3623921,47.7395106,,"September 1999 - First off, I would like to keep my name confidential; just for the fact that this happened on an Air Force base and I don't know who reads this stuff. This happened sometime in September of 99. I forget the exact date. It was early in the month though. It was between 2 and 3 a.m. I was a Security Forces Airman, working 3rd shift, on base patrol. Now mind you, this is an Air National Guard base that I worked at, full-time. It's on the North side of Duluth MN, next to the International Airport. North to northeast is nothing but large wooded areas. Forest areas. 3rd shift on the base was pretty boring (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and us full-timers worked a skeleton crew (usually only 5 - 6 of us, on 3rd shift). I was in the patrol truck, doing my usual rounds; checking doors and fence lines. Late at night, on the north side of the base was usually creepy enough when patrolling by yourself. Anyways; I was on this road, driving towards our baseball field, when my headlights caught a pair of eyes reflecting back at me. They were almost eye level with me, and I was sitting in an F-150. Around this time, a few of the guys had been seeing this huge buck around the property (like a 16 pointer or something around that size). I was about 80 yards or so, when I saw these eyes reflecting back at me. So, I'm thinking it was a big deer. ""I gotta see this thing."" So, I hit the gas and started speeding towards the field. This is where it all happened so fast. It's almost hard to explain. There was a little slope, behind the baseball field. It sloped down, probably about 12 - 15 feet, into a brush line. The brush went about 30 feet, then turned into a thick tree line. The brush was probably armpit high to me and pretty tough to traverse through; being so thick. As I turned into the baseball field and turned the truck towards the thing, I just caught the rear end of the thing leaping down the slope, below the line of sight of my headlights. The thing was no more than about 20 feet ahead of me when it leaped. All I got a look at was the back end of the thing, and it was big! The best I can do to describe it is to say that it was wolf/dog like in nature. It had a long tail (longer than 2 feet). The hind legs looked exactly like that of a dog's; same with the back paws, but the paws were huge. They were bigger than my hands, for sure. The hair/fur was wavy, yet matted and thick. The color was blondish or very light brown. I didn't notice any gray in it, but this all happened within about 2 - 3 seconds. I sat in my patrol truck for a couple of seconds, confused and thinking, ""I know what I saw, but it couldn't have been what I saw."" So, I hopped out, with my flashlight, and M-16 rifle, and walked to the edge of the slope. All I heard was the thing running through the woods in front of me, heading in a northwest direction. And this thing sounded like a moose charging through the trees! It made a lot of noise! That's when I started to get really scared; thinking, ""If this is some sort of wolf or whatever it could be, my M-16 isn't going to do a thing to this animal."" So, I jumped back into my patrol truck as fast as I could and headed back to the S.F. headquarters. I never told any of the other members about this, for fear of ridicule or being called crazy. There is no way I misidentified this thing! I'm a trained observer, an avid hunter and have worked with animal rehabilitation, with the MN DNR, in the past. I know my animals and the North Woods extremely well. I saw exactly what I saw. And that was the back end of a large wolf/dog thing, that basically had its eyes level with mine, while I was in a patrol truck. The back end was definitely much larger than any of the largest deer or black bears I've seen. The points I remember the clearest were the tail and back paws, as well as the texture and color of the hair/fur. This is my story. I have never told it to anyone, in fear of ridicule. I swear it to be the truth!"
Illinois,IL,Woodford County,-89.1705998,40.7128889,,"Date Unknown - I live in rural Illinois and had been experiencing strange noises and activity around my house for a period of a couple months, when one night, at around 4AM, my dog started to act up, like she wanted to go out. So; I went to let her out. Before I did that though, I flipped on the back flood lights and peered out, through the mini blinds, because I had a weird feeling. When I did that, in the back yard, about 75 feet away from me, this.... wolf/dog/man-like thing was standing upright, on two legs, looking at my back door! It had a proportionally huge head, with pointed ears on top and I noticed an amber-colored eye shine. Its head was K9 in appearance, like a German Shepherd or a wolf. It had broad, strong-looking shoulders, with accentuated deltoid muscles. Its torso was sunken in towards the abdomen, like a dog and it had no neck. Because of its massive head, it had an extreme, forward-leaning posture of around 60 degrees. It had thick, accentuated quad muscles in the front of its thighs that angled forward and tapered down to small knees. Below its knees, I could see that its lower legs angled back to hocks, just like a dog has. Because of its hocks, it looked like it could lean back on them, if it wanted to and leap or jump. Also, because of the way its legs looked, I got the impression it could jump and run very well. After a few moments of standing there, looking at my back door, it turned and walked into the cornfield that was behind my property. As it walked into the cornfield, I could still see its head, over the top of the corn stalks, which were around 8 feet tall, at that time. Having such a clear view of it chilled me to the bone! "
Illinois,IL,Christian County,-89.3226954,39.5672183,,"1991 - A friend of mine had moved south, to work with his uncle. Things didn't work out, so he called and wanted to know if I would pick him up, at the bus station, in Springfield. I told him, ""Sure."" The day he came back, his bus wasn't due until 1:30 am. When it showed up, he was starving, so we headed up the road, to Steak and Shake. While we were eating, some girls showed up, after a night of partying. We stayed around and talked with them, for a while. Well, by the time we left, Brian wanted to see if we could swing by one of his old girlfriend's houses, before she went to work. He wanted to see if he could stay with her, for a while. I didn't have anything to do the next day, so I told him that would be fine. She lived in Assumption. To get there, we headed back to Taylorville. Then, instead of heading on to Pana, where I lived, we would cut across, through the country, to get to Assumption. To do this, you have to go out by Bertinetti Lake. At that time, they had just started developing the place, for housing, so it was semi-rural, with woods around the lake and the road we were on. So, here we are driving and just about to cross a bridge, when this huge, canine-type thing comes running out of the woods, to our right. There were good-sized, freshly dug ditches on each side of the highway. This thing jumped from the bottom of the right ditch; cleared the highway, and landed on the backside of the left ditch. Then, it ran into the woods. It happened so fast, I didn't even have time to hit the brakes, before it was already gone. I know, some would say it was just a dog, that surprised us, but we both agreed, it was too big. Besides, I don't know of any dogs that can jump that far. I remember, it had gray and light brown fur. It was very bulky and muscular. It was also on all fours. We decided that we didn't need to hang around the area and sped up. We told our friends, but most just laughed it off. Whatever; we both knew what we saw. Years later, I was looking on the BFRO website. I saw there were two sightings reported, that took place, about a mile to the east, from where our encounter happened. When I first read the woman's report, years ago, she said it took off running, on all fours, and was wolf-like. I see now, someone has changed her story to sound more like a Bigfoot. However; her sighting and another reported after hers say that this was where Highway 48 crosses the south fork of the Sangamon River. Follow the river back east, until you see Lincoln Trail Road. That is the bridge we were at. It seems like it uses the river bottom to stay hidden. Also, there are all kinds of housing additions there, now. I went to their community-wide garage sales there, a few times. It seems as though a lot of cats and dogs go missing in that area. Posters were up everywhere. Well, I know it was a little long winded, but that was my encounter."
Illinois,IL,Cook County,-87.697554,41.7376587,,"Around 1973, my wife was living in Chicago and was about 11 years old, at the time. The area was inner city Chicago; not near the lake or the woods. It was Summer and she was spending the night with her girl cousins, in the basement bedroom of their house. In the early morning hours, around 4:00AM, the dog was growling and woke them up . Those type of basements have windows high on the wall. In one window, my wife saw something looking in. It was difficult to make out exactly what it was, but there was enough light outside from a street light to see the outline and movement of something looking through the window. The 3 girls all screamed, which woke and brought the 2 older boy cousins down, to see what was going on. The girls told them what they had seen and the boys, who had been sleeping in their clothes, ran out to investigate. The rest of this is their own account, which they reported, a short time afterwards. They saw ""someone"" running away and they chased after him. It took them a minute or so to get a good look at who they were chasing, because of the sparse lighting in the area, but they said what they saw looked like a large werewolf. They thought it was someone trying to pull a prank; a man wearing a very realistic werewolf costume; dismissing the possibility that it was real. They lost sight of it and eventually returned. So, that is about it. Knowing what we know now, we both think it must have been a Dogman.? "

Indiana,IN,Indianapolis,-86.158068,39.768403,,On. July 4th. 2012 at 2:00 pm. I saw a dogman cross my path in front of my bicycle. This beast was only 4 feet away from me.

Indiana,IN,Floyd County,-85.8895551,38.2869276,,"I had never heard of Dogmen but I saw one IN TOWN run past the floodgates, down by the river, on my way to the recently opened park that was closed due to floodwaters. It didn’t look like a scary werewolf but more like a weird dog, running on three legs. Its tail was curled up.
I went on a quest to find out what this was because I have never hallucinated and I knew what I had seen. The ones most people are reporting are not exactly like what I saw. However; had it stopped to look at me, I’m sure I would have found him quite a bit more frightening.

Indiana,IN,near Fort Wayne,-85.1393513,41.079273,,"A little background on me and where I live. I live just on the edge of a large city in Northeast Indiana. If you drive a quarter to half mile down the road from me, you will hit cornfields and farms going west and north. I have been in the paranormal community professional for about 10 years and have had my own paranormal team for three—BSR Paranormal--and am interested in all aspects of the paranormal. About 97% of what happens or that we see in photos and video we can debunk, but once in a while you can’t and this is one of the times. On Friday, August 12th, 2016, at around 6:30am, my 8 year old daughter and I were leaving for work and daycare. The sun was barely up so it was kind of sunny, but yet dark and very humid. As usual, we were running behind so I was telling her to hurry and get in the car so I wouldn’t be late for work—we aren’t very quiet in the morning. I told Ariana to go around and get in on the other side while I unlock the car (my key fob fell apart so I have to use the key). She went around the car and came back to the back driver’s door. I asked her why she wasn’t getting in the car and she said “I have to put my blanket in my bag”. I told her, “Ariana, your bag is on the passenger’s side, you didn’t have to come back over here”. I open my car door with my back to my neighbor’s car, I get in, sit down, shut the door, look over at my neighbor’s car, and see this solid black mass moving along the hood of their car. It was about a foot above it and you could tell it extended below it. I did not smell anything nor did I hear anything. When I saw this, I told Ariana, “GET IN THE CAR”. Of course she argued me because she was busy, I told her once again “I SAID GET IN THE CAR NOW”. I knew this was not an apparition, which I would’ve just ignored, and I didn’t have a very good feeling about this. When she did get in the car, she said “Mommy, were you just trying to scare me or did you see Bigfoot?” I said, “No Ariana that wasn’t Bigfoot” and she could tell I wasn’t joking around with her. I didn’t tell her what I saw until later that night when she questioned me again. It really doesn’t bother her or phase her because she’s grown up with me being the field and having experiences herself so she was fine with it. I did try to debunk what I had seen thinking it was her rear view mirror on her car because they're black. In order to see the passenger side mirror, I had to walk into the street and stand in front of her car. Last fall during the blood moon, Ariana and I went outside to see if we could see it and heard a wolf howling. At that time, we live just in front of the woods, about a block from where we are now. There are also coyotes and fox in the area, cornfields, there’s a creek that runs along the woods and the city has a lot of Indian history. "
Indiana,IN,Fort Wayne,-85.1393513,41.079273,,"June 2017 - On Wednesday night around 11:30pm my son's friend called him and said that something was knocking on his window and walking on his porch. He said he had heard howls and screams earlier in the night. We had seen him around 7:30pm, before dark and he headed home and got there around 7:45pm. This started happening between 7:45pm and 11:30pm. The friend calls back and said that it was pushing on his window and still knocking. He kept losing signal, he was using Facetime on his phone. I talked to him and had him turn his bedroom light off, which he did. We did hear knocking a couple of times while we were on the phone with him and my daughter and son also heard howls while on the phone. He said his dog was hiding in the corner and when he left his bedroom, the dog followed with its tail tucked between its legs. All of sudden he says ""it's back, I hear it walking on the porch again!"" I kept telling him to wake his dad up, but he was afraid to. I told him to make sure all the lights were off and his phone didn't give off a glow and slowly peek out the blinds. He did and told me that there was a ""big black, hair shadow on the porch. It looks about 10 feet tall"" He said he wasn't looking out again after dark. I told him to calm down, keep the lights off and try to get some sleep."
Indiana,IN,New Salisbury,-86.0949722,38.3136764,,"Contrary to what some may believe, this report was NOT submitted be-cause it’s October. A few years ago a parent at the school in which I (Charlie) teach informed me about her co-worker who had a possible bigfoot sighting. Being a bigfoot skeptic she was reluctant to tell me. However in this case she felt com-pelled to tell me about her co-worker’s encounter because she ex-plained to me that he is a highly in-telligent, no-nonsense, straight-forward man who would never make up such a story. After a year of missed communication trying to obtain his name and number, I gave up. Fortunately, last week when I spoke to this parent over the phone regarding her son’s grades, she mentioned to me that she found his phone number. I immediately called him that evening to set up an inter-view. We met Dave at his home on October 9, 2013 at 4:30 pm. Dave has worked as a registered nurse for 7 years and a chiropractor for 23 years which will prove very significant in this unique bigfoot sighting. Dave saw the creature twice within a two week period. During the first en-counter, he was driving home at 11:30 pm. As Dave approached his house, only a few houses down on his street, he observed a large animal on all fours run across the road directly in front of his car. It had dark brown, “rusty-colored” matted hair, a short snout, small pointed ears on the side of its head and it was much larger than a large dog. The height of its back was as high as a standard kitchen table, the front shoulders were considerably wider than the hips, and it galloped when it ran (bringing the front two legs/arms up together at the same time, then the rear two legs). It crossed the road very quickly. Needless to say, he thought this creature was very odd, especially when he saw it again a few weeks later, walking on two legs! Dave’s second encounter occurred at 6:30 am, just after sunrise. He was inside his home when he looked out his window and noticed a hairy, bi-pedal figure (estimated at 6’ 3”), with a very unusual gait, walking down his street. He had a clear, close view of the creature as it walked parallel to his home, only about 30 feet from his windows, although the sunrise was on the direct opposite side of the creature. After watching it from his windows, Dave ran outside to continue viewing this peculiar creature. When he doesn't immediately see it, he walked to the street and eventually saw it about 100 feet from his location, walking away from him on all fours. It turned and looked back at Dave and that’s when he realized this was the same creature he witnessed a few weeks earlier that darted in front of his car. It did not have a bulky, muscular build, but instead more of a normal, uniform build for its height. Based on Dave’s years of experi-ence in the medical field, he estimated its weight at about 200 lbs. The arms were slightly longer than a human’s and the head was proportionate to its body. The hair was short (maybe only an inch), matted and uniform in length/color throughout. Interesting Notes: When it was walking upright, it leaned forward, it did not walk heal to toe (more on the ball of its feet), the lower legs had a slight backward curve to them, it had a slight bounce to its step, it had a 3-4 inch snout and small pointed ears on the side of its head."

Iowa,IA,Linn County,-91.6760691,42.0659844,7/1/2014,"7/1/2014 - I was on patrol as a deputy sheriff for the county and was usually assigned to the Highway 13 and highway 30 corridors. However, I recall that particular July first however that a young man, 16 or 17-year-old, had been sucked into a storm drain which emptied into cedar lake near the Quaker Oats plant. This is a place with heavy foot traffic and located in an urban setting the area is also bordered by Mohawk Park. As the search went on, into the night, the local PD got the county involved. I parked my cruiser at what I believe was the electric company storage yard, the yard had what I estimated to be a ten-foot fence that ran parallel to a paved bike trail on the other side of which runs a large concrete spillway to siphon off flood waters. I arrived at what I estimate to be roughly 11:30 PM to 11:45 PM. I estimate only because I assure you there never was, nor will be, an official statement or record with my name on it telling this story. As I left the lot I was at the north end of the lake and headed west on foot There was a lot of brush and saplings between the spillway and trail so I proceeded on to the point the trail turns south near where cedar lake empties into the cedar river under the railroad tracks leading into Quaker oats. There are multiple tracks at the turn I mentioned before and only the track furthest from myself had a train on it. With my attention on the spillway, I hardly noticed at first a faint red colored light a distance north from my position. It was coming down the track on the other side of the train. I had thought it perhaps the tail lights of a car, not being from that patrol route I had no knowledge that there was, in fact, no road in that direction. There ain’t much things in the world that scare me, put simply I’ve seen some shit in my fucken days. But nothing prepared me for that night. The lights disappeared and that was that or so I had figured. About five minutes pass before I hear a snorting almost sniffing sound coming from the other side of the tracks. When I turned the first thing I saw were the eyes. They glowed a dull red, the thing was at least 8 foot tall pushing 450 I judge this by the fact that I am 6’4, and weight 280. I turned my light and to this day wish I hadn’t. It had pointed ears and a long muzzle and it looked me right in the face before it bolted Into the timber. It was not a mask and it was NOT, a person in a costume. Who would walk up on an armed man with a police radio in full uniform and risk getting shot? I remember it was surreal, so final I guess. I know what’s in the dark now. people can say or think what they want but even with a chambered round and full magazine in a Glock 40. Didn’t feel like enough firepower. I unholstered and fell back toward the trail and to the electric company storage yard. putting the fence to my back I made a hasty retreat to the lot with my cruiser. I don’t think I holstered my pistol til I got out of the park. I never spoke of it then and honestly don’t know why I am now but one thing is for certain it knew I was there and it was watching my every move. I’ll never go back and I no longer work with the department since becoming a minister. But I still carry a Glock with hollow point rounds tipped with silver if, and I rarely do, leave my home at night."
Wisconsin,WI,Brown County,-87.9334803,44.4561674,,"2005/2006 - This happened to me when I was 10 or 11. I’m just about to turn 20 now, but I’ll never forget what happened that day.

I was at my grandparents house, who were watching me for the day. They live out, in a mixture of farmland and woods, in rural Wisconsin. Their yard is mostly surrounded by farmland, but to the right side of the yard is a couple acres of woods and a swamp. It was a really hot, muggy morning, in July. I was standing out on the deck, shooting at some cans, with my BB gun. All of a sudden, I got the sense something was wrong. It felt like I was being watched. I started scanning the treeline and down at the edge of the trees, about 60 yards away, by the swamp/woods was this thing, standing, that I can only describe as a Dogman. It was about 7 feet tall, covered with shaggy gray hair, had the “classic” Dogman face (long snout, pointed ears on top of head), yellow eyes, and it was very muscular. It was standing on 2 legs, but it appeared to be sort of leaning up against a tree. We locked eyes and while it was probably only 10 seconds, it felt like hours. It sounds silly, but I felt the thing had a sinister grin on its face. It was extremely intimidating! I know that had that thing wanted to kill me, it easily could have done that. I could relive this encounter, at my age now, with a shotgun, instead of a BB gun, and I’d still be just as terrified as I was then.

It definitely had a very negative and sinister vibe to it. After locking eyes with the thing, it just bolted off on 2 legs, through some of the swamp and emerged farther down the treeline, and then ran off, into the forest. At first, I thought it might have been one of my older cousins, playing a joke on me, who live nearby, but then I realized, there was no way they could be wearing a suit, be 7 feet tall, and clear the swamp as fast as that thing did.

I wasn’t gonna tell grandma and grandpa I saw a Werewolf, down by the swamp, They’d never believe me. So, I just kept my mouth shut and tried to carry on with my day there. Well, later that afternoon, I was talking to my aunt and she brought up the fact that she had heard strange noises the night before. When I asked what they sounded like, she said it was a lot of snarling, and growling, and it kind of sounded like an animal being attacked."
Wisconsin,WI,Burnett County,-92.2888131,45.8051186,,"I’m a skeptic of the supernatural, but I believe anything is possible. I won’t discount supernatural occurrences if I can’t find a logical explanation for them. I’ve experienced a few incidents I couldn’t explain, but I’m going to tell you about the 1 that freaked me out the most, though.

So here it goes! I live in the Twin Cities, in Minnesota, USA. A lot of people in the cities have cabins in either northern MN or rural Wisconsin. Our cabin was in rural Wisconsin, in a small town called “Danbury.” The cabin is on Long Lake, at the very end of Long Lake Rd. Along with the cabin came almost an acre of land, covered by thick forest. We carved a trail through the land for ATV’s and whatnot. So, the scene is set…

Now; about me. I’m an outdoor enthusiast and have been forever. I’m 6’4, fit, and have been a hunter since I was like 12. I know my environment, the wildlife, and the forest well, and am typically comfortable in the woods. I come from a military family and am trained in multiple forms of combat (armed and unarmed). I also have extensive firearms training and as a result, am fairly confident in my ability to defend myself. I’m not really scared of people. Big predators on the other hand, like bears, wolves, man-bear-pig, whatever; I’m not a big fan of. This brings me to the weirdness.

I’m 23 now, but at the time of the incident, I was 16. Even at 16, I was a decent hunter and had good common sense. Anyway; I was at the cabin with my cousin and grandparents. It was the middle of summer (I think July, with hot temps and whatnot). My cousin and I were shooting at each other with Airsoft guns. We had a full-on battle going on throughout the property, including the woods, which were my stalking grounds. I was wearing my BDU’s, with face cover and all, as well as head to toe camo. Our battle ended up about 100 yards northwest of the cabin, into the woods. We ended the war on the main trail and were standing and talking about the events that had transpired. I was still on guard because I always am. I suppose I could be considered to be a tad paranoid. Alright; so we were standing there talking when I noticed something move at our 12 o’clock, about 50 meters out. I got quiet and focused dead ahead, scanning. My cousin was still talking, so I whispered, “Shhhh.” So, he shut up. I figured the movement I had seen was just a bird or something. As a joke and to freak him out, I told him we were being watched. That’s when I noticed that the woods were dead-quiet. No birds were chirping. There was no sound. That’s when I started to think, this only happens when a big predator is around. So, I started looking even closer. That’s when I saw it. At my 12 o’clock, there was this large animal. It had reddish, brown fur and almost blended in perfectly until I focused on it. It had long front limbs (arm-like), with what appeared to be formidable claws and it was standing kind of slouched down, against a tree, like it was trying to be stealthy. Even though it was standing like that, it was nearly as tall as me. The only reason why I saw it was because of its teeth. I think it was panting because its whitish teeth were visible. Its snout appeared to be a tad elongated. I couldn’t get a better look, because my first thought was, “We have to go!” I even said it out loud. My cousin was already freaked. When I said those words, he bolted up the trail, towards the cabin. He nearly left me in the dust, because instead of running when he did, I waited a good 3 seconds (I was being protective of him); keeping my eye on it, until I saw it move (It was fast!). That’s when I ran like hell! I didn’t see which way it ran. All I know is that I heard it crashing through the woods. My cousin stopped at the shed, which was still 50 meters from the cabin, to wait for me. When I caught up, I yelled, “GO, GO, GO!” And we both bolted to the cabin. We got inside and shut the door. My grandma asked why we looked panicked and had slammed the door shut. I knew they wouldn’t believe me, so I said that we had seen a bear. My cousin nodded.

Later that night, after my grandparents went to sleep, we talked about it. I asked my cousin if he had seen it. He told me that he had paused for a second, to look back, after he ran, to see if I was running with him. He said that he had seen me still looking at it. He said that’s when he saw it move and I run. He said he had mostly just seen a flash of fur. He went on to say, he thought it wasn’t the right color to be a bear. I also agreed that it wasn’t the right color to be one and told him that we only had black bears in the area and that it wasn’t built like a bear either. I told him I never thought it was a bear. He asked me why I had lied about it to my grandparents. I told him they wouldn’t have believed us. We’ve kept it between the 2 of us, until now.

Still; the animal didn’t match any known regional animal profiles in the area. I’m at a loss for what it may have been. I do know it was stalking us though and that it was built like an athletic predator. Not like a bear. It wasn’t as heavyset as a bear would have been.

After the incident, neither of us would go into the woods on foot, alone, without a gun. We generally only went back in the woods on ATV’s from that point forward. I always loved that cabin, up until then. Fortunately, the cabin has been sold now."
Wisconsin,WI,Burnett County,-92.2888131,45.8051186,,"This is a difficult thing for me to write down, on paper. I had no idea what a cryptid was until my son told me about his encounter, just before it aired on your show. All these years, I have thought that what I had seen was just a very deformed bear. Just so you know, I was driving that night and I never drink and drive… I was 100 percent sober! I haven’t even talked about my encounter since it happened…. Until I told my son. Since then, I have told my best friend. She encouraged me to contact you, after we listened to my son’s episode together.

Most evenings, just about an hour before dark, some of us enjoyed going for “deer rides.” We had a route we would always use. It started out on Rustic Road, which was southwest of our Cabin, on Long Lake, just south of Danbury, WI. The route took us to a place that went through a wildlife preserve, and then we ended up on the road that goes from Hinckley, MN to Danbury, WI. The road through the preserve always made me uncomfortable, because it was a swampy bog on both sides of the road. It was a narrow gravel road and in order to turn around, you would need to go down a very narrow drive, to a parking area for hunters. I had only been in one of those parking areas once and it creeped me out! We never saw deer on that road, so we typically went fast in that area. We would have avoided that gravel road altogether, but we always saw deer just before the preserve and just after. On this evening, it was just my sister-in-law and I that went on the deer ride. This happened 15 or 16 years ago, so we did not have cell phones. Sometimes, we would take cameras to take pictures of deer. This night, we didn’t have a camera with us.

It was a hot night, and we had our windows down because the air conditioner wasn’t working. I was driving a large car. A 1998 Cadillac. We had just started down that creepy road, when we noticed something black on the road, about a 1/2 a mile ahead of us. We were driving pretty fast. As we got closer, it appeared to be dark gray in color. It also appeared to have an elongated muzzle. It had its back to us, but it was a little sideways, so we could tell it was eating something in the road. I stopped the car and just kept my foot on the brake. This animal had very wide, muscular shoulders and its fur was longer than a bear’s. Its ears were pointy, like a German Shepherd’s and stood straight up, on top of its head. This animal had hands. It was holding a dead rabbit, I think. I was talking to Amy. I said, “What is that?” I think I was verbalizing every thought that came into my head. I was totally freaked out! The animal noticed us. It started to turn its head. That’s when I turned on my headlights. It wasn’t dark yet, but I wanted to see this thing better. It turned and faced my car. The head lights caught its eyes…I couldn’t believe what I was seeing! Its eyes glowed reddish orange in the headlights. I freaked! To me, this creature was demonic in nature! Then it stood up straight, on its back legs. As this thing moved, it was jerky, like it wasn’t comfortable in its own skin. It was not a natural movement. The animal sprinted at my car. It took at least 6 steps. I gunned my car right at it. I was in a panic! I was terrified! It turned right, still upright, then dropped to all fours. Its legs had an odd bend in them, like backward knees. I just screamed, “What is that!!!” It ran into the swamp and I got the hell out of there!

We stopped on the road to our cabin. By then it was dark. When we stopped, Amy and I both cried. We couldn’t stop shaking! We talked about what we had just seen. We both agreed, we would tell people we had seen a bear. To be honest, at that time, I honestly thought it WAS a deformed bear. Today, I know it was not. I am no longer in denial. What I saw, I cannot understand or explain…. It was just plain evil in nature. So wrong….very wrong!"
Wisconsin,WI,Horicon Marsh,-88.6241351,43.5043614,,"Since June 2017 the eyewitness has been seeing something at night when he goes out into his yard. At first he didn't know what it was but he could see large yell\ow eyeshine approx 3 ft off the ground. States that when he sees this being he gets a fight or flight feeling. He told the being, ""I'm not afraid of you so don't mess with me."" His neighbor also saw the being in the dark that night. When the eyewitness started to walk towards the being it backed up. The witness went forward again and the being went up the tree. It sounded heavy but it didn't growl or anything, it just watched him. He said that he went inside to get his knife and when he came back out, the being was gone. His neighbor said that he was walking the Ice Age Trail at night & heard heavy breathing trailing him & his wife although he couldn't see anything but he says that he did hear something with long nails walking on the pavement & it sounded like there was more than 1 being. He also heard a hyena type laughter from the being. The neighbor says that he then saw 5 sets of eyeshine, 4 pairs of yellow & 1 pair of red. Says the eyeshine was above his head & he is 5 ft 11 inches, so the beings had to be at least 6.5 to 7 feet tall. The howl they heard was similar to the Dogman howl on the NADP website. Thursday, it was trash day. Neighbor was taking his trash to the curb at 2 am before he went to work & in the lights of his truck he saw something in front of his truck. He said it looked like a wolf on steroids, very muscular. He said that the head reached his neighbor's chest when it was on all fours. It looked like a bodybuilder. It stared at him and yipped. The neighbor left then. He said the eyeshine was yellow/amber. A week later, the eyewitness was taking his dogs out of their backyard kennels & bringing them into the house. The witness let his Bulldog in and then saw 2 eyes shining yellow in his yard. The witness said the being was about 40 feet from him. It had huge eyeshine. He calmly told it, ""I don't care if you are here but don't mess with my family or my dogs."" Then he put his other dog in the house and went in himself. At approximately 3 am they were woken by loud animal noises that sounded like a whistle, scream and hum all at the same time. It seemed like there was some infrasound involved. About 2 weeks ago the witness and his neighbor saw the being about 8:30 pm and it was still light out. His neighbor had built a bonfire and when they were done, he poured water on it & it smoked & made noise that must have startled the being who was sitting on all four feet in some taller grass some feet away. They didn't see it sitting in there until the fire smoked and sizzled and then the being rose up out of the tall grass on 2 legs. It looked around and then looked at them. He says it had very large muscles but a skinny waist as though it had no body fat. It looked like it had human shoulders but exaggerated and massive. He said it looked like it had a hump on its back but he thinks that was muscle. He said that the quads were thick & then from the knees down the legs were skinnier. It had pointed ears and was wolfish looking with a bushy tail like a wolf and that it was black. It had 2 white stripes starting at the ears & running down to the chest. It was watching them from the tall grass. It started running towards the woods 1st on 4 legs & then on 2 & then back on 4. The witness got a spotlight & headed for the trail where the being had headed. Because there were ditches on either side of the trail and he thought the being could be hiding in the ditch, he decided to go back. Witness doesn't think the being is around right now. Thinks it was curious & not stalking them or threatening them. "
Wisconsin,WI,Price County,-90.4622144,45.7511666,,"August 2008 - My wife and I were driving back to our cabin we have in the north woods, after visiting friends in town. It was a hot, muggy, summer night, but it was cooling down fast, which made it start to get foggy. The road went about a half-mile, through a spruce bog, then up a hill, to where a farm field was, on the right. Hardwoods were on the left.

I was in my mid-fifties at the time and did not believe in “things” like what we were about to see. Out of the fog, from the farm field, going from right to left, came a creature. The creature was about eight to ten feet off the ground. The best way to describe what we saw would be to say, it looked like a person who had jumped off a trampoline and took off with their arms stretched out, in front of them, with their legs bent. It was upright however and was covered all over with fur. It was not a coyote or wolf, but looked like a cross between a man and some kind of canine. It had pointy ears and a long snout. My wife later said the head reminded her of the ancient Egyptian god, with a dog head, (but furry). It landed flat on its feet, directly in front of my wife’s van, no more than twenty feet away. The craziest thing is, it landed and jumped like a kangaroo; flying back off, into the fog. Its arms were still sticking straight out, in front of it. It did not act or look like any canine we know of. We had been going slowly, because of the fog. As soon as she saw that thing, she stopped the van. We just looked at each other, like, “Did we really just see that?” However; we did see it. And it still freaks us out, to this day.

Another weird thing is, we both felt that it was not of this world. It did not move naturally and that was just the feeling we got. We don’t tell many people about what we saw, because the people we have told don’t believe or want to believe we saw what we saw. However; I did tell a good friend of mine, who didn’t laugh, because he said, when he was a little kid, his father, who was a logger, used to tell him about loggers in the woods seeing “Dog man”.

I’m so glad I found this website. I see that other rational people have seen similar creatures. Like some others, I was with someone who witnessed it too. It must be really difficult for someone who sees one of these things, by themselves, to try and explain to others what they saw."

Honey Creek Encounter
Dogman Sighting details::
My sighting occured in March of 2018 near the village of Rochester,Wisconsin. It was about 11pm at night and i had left my home to make the short trip to walmart to pick up some items needed by my fiance for work the next day, mainly lunch foods and underarm deodorant. Rochester Wisconsin is located in southeast wisconsin alongside the Fox river,between two nature preserves. It is mainly forested land with hills and a few open fields. As i was on my way to walmart there is a hill you must climb before leveling out at the top of the hill. At the top of the hill is a little gravel pull off named Honey Creek. As im coming up the hill and around a slight curve, i noticed something standing in the middle of the road a little before the pull off. My first immediate reaction was ""why is that huge dog just standing there?"" and ""what is going on !?"". My next thought was ""thats the biggest black german sheppard i have ever see"". As i got a little closer to this animal i hit it with my bright beams and completely lit it up, at that point this thing just stared at me for about 4-5 seconds and then rocked back on its hind legs and stood up on only its back legs, turned around to face the way it was coming from, and leaped(yes leaped) into the ditch and then shot of like it was fired out of a cannon and disappeared into the tree line. The color of this animal was completely black . It had very long front legs and its back hindquarters were very mucular, kind of like a pit bulls body physique but much larger. The head of this thing looked basically like a sheppard/wolf but the muzzle was wider and resembled that of a bulldog type dog instead of a wolf or shepard. When it stood up and turned ,it was still facing and glaring at me but i was able to briefly see what i can only call shoulders like a hominid and what looked to be pectoral muscles under a very thin layer of fur/hair, much shorter that on the rest of its body, so much thinner it seemed like you could almost see skin. I have since done some research and listened to many encounters on youtube and everyone says they felt fear, i personally felt no fear just confusion and then amazment at how fast it moved . I dont know what these things are but i can now faithfully assure you they are real. Thank you.

Wisconsin,WI,Rock County,-89.0179332,42.6251506,,"It was July 2004, 3 of my friends and I were out in a field, just having a good time, messing around. That’s when we heard some noises off in a field, a couple hundred yards away. We didn’t think too much of it. A little while later, we kept hearing the noises getting louder. We could also hear trees breaking and things like that. We tried to ignore it, but we soon found out that ignoring those sounds was a bad idea.

We saw a creature that was 7, to 8 feet tall, coming toward us. The creature stood like a human and acted as a human would, but it looked like a dog or a wolf. We were completely surprised. We had no idea what was going on! We ran back to our cars as fast as we could and drove away."
Wisconsin,WI,Wood County,-90.0746767,44.4747774,,"Maybe 5 years ago; one night, I was at a friend’s house out in the country, in Vesper, WI, when my friend’s car turned in and came rushing up the driveway. The car came to a halt and 2 of my other friends jumped out.

They explained that they had seen something they just couldn’t describe. I asked them if they got a good look at whatever had them so shook up. They looked at each other and said “Yes.”

They said they were driving through the country, on their way to join us, and were driving past a farm when they noticed something in the ditch. The friend who was driving said he flashed his brights to get a better look, and whatever it was raised up and ran across the road on all 4’s. It looked like it could walk on 2 legs if it wanted to, they both said. They also said it looked like it was half dog, half man. Or maybe half dog and half monkey. They couldn’t explain how the creature looked any better than that. They just kept trying to compare it to other animals. They said they were about 20 yards from it, the brights were on, and they got a good look at it.

Well… That’s the story. I’ll never forget how stricken their faces were with panic and fear. I don’t think they were lying."
Ohio,OH,Brookville,-84.4113366,39.8367207,,"4-8-17 - Maree was laying across her bed awake, when she heard a low, deep growl from just outside the window. She called to her mom (Jenn) in the living room, who informed me via VOIP app that Maree had heard this growl. While talking to the two of them, Maree heard a second growl from outside her room, loud enough for her to hear it in the living room as she was speaking. Had them move to the same room (living room) for the rest of the night for safety. 

UPDATE: I was informed this morning, that the family dog (Lily) continued to bark and whimper, as if terrified, toward the area of Maree’s room off and on through most of the night. This morning, Jenn went outside to check the area near Maree’s window for tracks. Air was still, no wind/breeze, she encountered a residual stench that “smelled like something had died there” when looking for possible tracks. She took photos of the area, finding places where grass had been stomped down, as if something large was milling in one spot. I arrived at her home at approximately 11:00 AM, she showed me the area, in surveying I found 3 potential prints, where grass was still mashed down and hadn’t revived fully from whatever had stepped on it. No visible prints on bare ground spots. Potential prints were 6-9 feet from the outside wall and window of the house."
Alabama,AL,Walker County,-87.3016132,33.8563605,,"In 1969, I was 9 years old and lived about 1/2 a mile down the road from an old church and cemetery. There were 2 other old houses there, no one lived in. There were strange things happening quite often around where we lived back then. I remember one of the strange things that happened, very well. My dad worked evenings, from 3PM until 11PM, just 3 miles down the road from our house. My mom, sister, and I had just gone to bed, when we started to hear a bumping sound on the back of the house. My sister and I ran from the bedroom we shared, in the back of the house, to the front of the house, where mom and dad's bedroom was. My sister and I were scared, so mom let us sleep with her, until dad came home at 11, that night. Their bedroom had 2 windows, side by side, on the front of the house, above the porch. You could see through the curtains at night, due to the street light out front. We were lying there after not hearing anymore noise, when all of a sudden, we heard something on the front porch. Mom saw it first, and sat up in bed. That made my sister and I notice her staring out the window. When we turned our gaze from mom to the window, we saw what looked like a very large dog on the front porch. It was walking to the front door upright, on it's back legs. When it reached the front door, it shook it violently. It was as tall as the door and we could see it scratching at the screen door with its front paws. It remained there for what seemed like 15 minutes, but it was probably only a minute, or 2. Mom didn't say a word for the first minute, or 2. She just shushed us, until it turned and walked about 10 feet, to the steps, on its back legs. Just before it reached the steps and went down them, it went down on all 4 legs. Mom told us to go back to sleep and we eventually did. I don't remember her telling my dad, but I do remember this well. It was 6, to 6 1/2 feet tall, while standing upright, on its back legs. You could see all of its facial features. Its ears, snout, and its head. Those features made it resemble a German Shepherd. We hadn't seen anything that looked or acted like that thing in the area before that night. A lot of strange things happened there. I can't say it was a Dogman, but it did walk on its back legs, for several feet. Another time, when I was young, my sister, who I shared the back bedroom with at the time, was at our grandma's house, spending the night. I had gone to bed, but wasn't asleep yet. Mom had my bedroom window open, so air could get in. It was hot that night. The back of our house was high off the ground. Consequently, the bottom of my bedroom window was 8 feet off the ground. I had been lying there, on my back, when I rolled over onto my stomach, toward the window. My foot went off the bed on the window side and wound up being only a few inches from the window. All of a sudden, something touched my foot! I don't remember if it grabbed my foot or what, but the screen ripped, the curtain fell, and I scrambled off the bed, and out of my bedroom, into the living room, where mom was! She had heard the commotion and saw that I was frightened. She asked me what was wrong, so I told her what had happened. She went into my bedroom and saw the hole in the screen and that the curtain was down. She also saw how it was hanging half-way out the window. She didn't know what to think, so she called dad home from work. He came home to check it out and walked around the house, before coming in. He said he hadn't seen anything. At first, he didn't believe mom. It wasn't until he saw that the curtain was hanging out the window that he believed her. He couldn't figure it out. We didn't have any problems with prowlers. At first, they thought I had stuck my foot through the screen. I don't think that's what happened, because I wasn't sleeping yet. I just couldn't have done that."
Florida,FL,Leon County,-84.1857115,30.4906177,,"Date Unknown - Ok. I'm sharing this story in hopes of someone else having another one. And I then will have this one out in the open. I was traveling Highway 10, from the west coast, to the south coast of Florida. I was with my 6 kids, and pulling a trailer with all of my belongings and 3 dogs in it. I was in a big S.U.V., and it was around 2am. The kids were all asleep, and my 13 year old daughter was in the passenger seat, to make sure I stayed awake. So, after traveling Highway 10 for 3 days, I had decided since we reached Florida, we would cut through the state, to save some time. So, we got off Highway 10 on an off road, in hopes of getting gas and making up some time. It was along Route 27 (Apalachicola National Forest). We came to the first little gas station. It was closed. I was nervous, because we needed gas. So, we continued on. I told my daughter to keep an eye out for deer crossing the 2 lane, deserted highway. Because, hitting a deer could kill us all and turn us over, due to the trailer we were pulling. We were traveling around 45 miles per hour. I remember this so clearly, like it was yesterday. But it was three years ago. We had our brights on, because the road was dark and winding. A few houses were on that highway, but not many. As we came around a corner, in the headlights, on the road, there was a lot of blood. Fresh blood. And on the side of the road was this 6 or 7 foot tall creature. It was on its hind legs, hunched over a dead deer, eating it. It did not look up. Not even when my headlights hit it. It was using its arms like a human, eating the deer. It had a very muscular body, pointed ears and a long muzzle. If you ever saw a werewolf, this was it! It had a skinnier lower body, but used its arms and hands just like a human. If it looked up, I would have died! I looked over at my daughter. We were both seeing the same thing, at the same time. Tears came to my eyes instantly, and at the same time, we both said, ""werewolf!"" I sped up, because I was scared it would run and jump on the trailer and kill my dogs. As we got about a mile away, my heart was beating so hard! My daughter and I were so freaked out! It was a werewolf! I have never been a believer in werewolves. I don't watch any werewolf movies or have any reason to make this up. And as a matter of fact, until today, I have only told a handful of people about this. There is a werewolf in Florida! Not sure of the exact town or road, but I wish I did know, so I could find out if we were the only ones to have seen this thing. I will live my life wondering. It was between Alabama to Florida, along the pan handle. I will never forget this night ever!"

A walk in the park...
Dogman Sighting details::
here is my dogman story. Let me know what you think. Lets see, I'll start off and say that I wasn't expecting anything to happen. Me and my other half Steve went to his friend's annual CB get together at Grant County Park in Crittenden, Kentucky. That's around forty-five minutes away from where we live. It was the first of October and the weather was nice, round the seventies. Plenty of space to explore considering that the park is fifty-four acres. Containing a playground area, one baseball diamond with lights and a basketball court. The picnic area has five shelter houses, there is a horse ring with a barn and stadium, and two multi-purpose buildings. I love nature and so much space appealed to me when dealing with people. I took a few joints with me to help with the pain and keep me calm. The get together was from noon to whenever and a lot of people showed up. I bring cupcakes with us, which I feel like a dumbass to find out that Steve's friend was a di! abetic and sugar was a no no. So not a first good impression, oh well screw it. After grabing something to eat I decided to go walk around, since Steve knew most there. Lets see the picnic spot that we were at was up front, I decided to walk around, smoke and explore the other side. During my walk I was taking pictures here and there on my phone, I love taking pictures. I noticed that I was being pulled to the woods behind the baseball diamond. Goosebumps covered my whole arms instantly. I knew I was being compelled to go to that spot, it was a very strong urge. I didn't feel anything evil or that, it was just extremely creepy to me that as strong as the pull was I knew something was there. So I took my phone out and stopped walking. I ended up close to this tree which caught my eye anyways and I took a few pictures then started walking back to where everyone was. Even though I still felt the strong urge to go where I was being pulled. Later that night when we were at home I was looking at my pictures I took and doing some grey scale pictures with them because they look awesome that way. I noticed the one picture I did in grey scale the tree, it had a spirit in it. You could see it so clearly, I showed it to Steve and he thought that was cool then asked what was that by the bush That's when I saw it, a pair of eyes staring at me in the area I was being pulled to! I got goosebumps immediately as soon as I saw that. I thought that what I had captured with my photo was a hellhound, but when I finally showed my pictures to my friend Teresa who was into ufos, Bigfoot and;and I knew she would be interested. When I told her where we went when I took my pictures she told me it wasn't a hellhound but a dogman.I'm a believer and have a very open mind, I have seen and experienced a lot. So to say that this is so cool, it is. She didn't think so and said I was lucky it didn't follow me home. But the truth is that I ! didn't feel threatened or anything by it.

Kentucky,KY,Kenton County,-84.564147,38.9863872,,"December 2013 - I used to work about 30 miles away from where I live. One night, I had been stuck in heavy traffic, coming home. I take Lasix, so after awhile, I really had to go to the bathroom. I kept telling myself that I was almost home and tried to hold it until I got there. By the time I got to my exit, I knew I wasn’t going to make it to my house, so I pulled up to an area where Fidelity Investments is located and found an area that was isolated. This area is heavily wooded, with walking trails and a lot of game, but it is also in a very populated area. I pulled up a little side-drive, off one of the main roads. That little drive is about 100 feet long, with only room for 1 car. It went up in elevation and had bushes on the right side, facing the main road. On the left side, there was a guardrail and a view of the valley below. The area up there is huge and isolated, with several buildings that are all spaced out. The place is dark at night because there are intermittent street lights up there. At night it’s pretty deserted too. A few cars go through that area, though, because it’s a shortcut people use to go from Taylor Mill over to 3L highway, where there are stores, restaurants, etc. When you’re up there, you’re above everything around this area.

When I stopped, I got out of my car, waited a moment and looked around, to make sure there were no other cars. It was winter, so the bushes between where I was and the road below me didn’t have many leaves on them. Because of that, you could see right through them. I was up on this little rise, about 20 or 30 feet above the drive, which was 4 lanes wide. To the left of me was a street light and more woods that went down another hill, to the main road. I went to the back of my car and did what I had to do. When I finished, I stood up and all at once, every hair on my body stood up. I knew I wasn’t alone. I scanned the area in front of me and must have heard something behind me because I turned around and there were 3 deer standing there, all huddled up together, between my car and the guardrail. They weren’t looking at me. They were looking across the road. I looked back over there and that was when I saw a figure standing between the bushes in front of it and the tree line behind it. It was huge! I stand 5’5. Some of those bushes were about 6-feet tall, but they only came up to about the collarbone area on this thing. Due to the street light, to the right of it, about 20 ft. away, I was able to get a pretty clean outline of this thing. It had a large dog-shaped head and pointed ears. I couldn’t make out its neck, but I could make out massive shoulders. That’s when it growled. It was a deep vibration I could feel in my chest. My body just took over at that point.

I have to explain this part of it to you. I worked security for years, in California, in the music business. As a woman, I have to really work out and train to defend myself. I kicked boxed for 8 years and worked out every day. I also train dogs. Mainly Anatolian Shepherds and German Shepherds. Sometimes, I have to establish who is the alpha and to do that, I get them down, hold them in place, grab them by their ear and growl until they submit. Then the training can start. So, when this thing growled at me, it was just pure instinct. I dropped down to a crouching position and growled, right back at it. When I did that, it stopped growling and started sniffing the air. Its snout went up and it turned its head slightly as it was sniffing. It then took a few steps forward. I was still crouched down, on all 4’s and moved forward, still growling at the thing. When I did that, it stopped. I stood up and kept staring right at it. I never broke eye contact with it. Then, it slowly stepped back into the tree line, until I couldn’t make it out as clearly as before and started to move to the right of me. The deer were still behind me. They were so close I could have reached out and touched them. I waved my arms and told them to get out of there. When I did that, they went back over the guardrail and took off down the hill. That’s when I jumped in my car and got out of there as fast as I could. I felt this thing was trying to circle behind me and I wasn’t going to wait around for that! Do I think I scared it? NO. But, I do think I confused it for a couple of minutes and that gave me time to move.

I told my husband about what had happened up there, but I didn’t tell him exactly what I saw. He would think I was nuts and to be honest, I thought I was a little crazy myself until I saw a picture of a Dogman. I know there are other things in this world that can’t be explained. I’ve seen them. But, this was beyond any of those things.

Since this has happened, I can’t take that shortcut through that area, anymore. My husband took me back over that way once, to see the area and I was begging him to get me out of there the whole time. I thought I was going to throw up.

The wildlife up there has almost totally disappeared. I never see anything up on the hills anymore. The street I live on is only about 1 mile or so down the hill from this place and lately, we have seen coyotes on the streets, like they have been chased out and pets here have started to go missing. We’ve also seen a large, black figure moving through our backyards down here. The dogs throughout the neighborhood go crazy regularly now, too. People were calling the cops when we saw that large, black figure jumping fences. I’m concerned that it has come down the hill, after eating everything up there."
Louisiana,LA,Jefferson Parish,-90.1120696,29.6498691,11/17/2012,"11/17/2012 - My encounter happened a few years ago, in South Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Here in Louisiana, we call county's parishes, in case you didn't know. ?I was hunting deer or wild pigs one night, on a protection levee system that was built to protect the town from hurricane flood waters. As I walked to where the levee turns off to the left, there was a canal woods that was about a 100 yards from some houses. To the left was a natural ridge that goes out, into swamps and marshes. Well; as I made that turn from the ridge of oak trees, I heard a growl. I thought it might have been a coyote or dog, so I walked slower. Then, I heard brush and a smaller size tree shake and another growl. I shined my light in the direction of the sound and saw a pair of eyes that were reflecting an amber/yellow color. What surprised me was the fact that the brush was about 6 foot high and the eyes were about a foot above the brush! When I saw those eyes, I slowly backed up, while keeping my light on the thing. As I walked back to the turn, to head back to my truck, which was parked about 3/4 of a mile away; it came out the woods. I lit the thing up with my light again. Now; I was probably 30 feet from it. I saw its whole body and face! The body was covered with black hair, with some brown mixed in. The hair was thickest around its head, neck, chest and upper back. It looked a lot like a lion’s mane, but wasn’t as pronounced; since all of the hair was the same color. It had pointy ears, with a little bit of hair coming off the points, making the ears seem a little longer. It stood on two legs, but the legs were weird and backwards like. The arms were really long; longer then the legs. Its hands were like a mixture of human and bear; like really big Raccoon front paws. It had paws, but it also had fingers. That’s the only way to describe it. If you watch the movie, “The Howling,” you’ll get an idea what this thing looked like. It's as if whoever made that movie new something others didn’t. Now; at this point, I was freaking out, so I pulled up my rifle. I hunt with a Romanian AK, with a camo paint job, I did myself. The way I was hunting wasn't exactly legal. That’s why I took my Romanian AK. If I had to toss it, I wouldn’t be out much money. The rounds I use are special rounds, made to hunt feral hogs. I’ve dropped deer and hogs with these rounds before. 1 shot and they’re done. But back to the story; as I pulled my rifle up, to the ready, it growled and walked a few steps toward me. I fired a round right into its chest area. I knew I had hit it, because the creature took a step back. As it stepped back, I ran toward my truck. That’s when it let out a loud growl and a howl like I had never heard before. I grew up hunting and fishing and thought I knew everything in the woods, but I hadn’t heard anything like the sounds it made before. As I ran back to the truck, it stalked me, but kept its distance. As I got close to the well-lit area, where my truck was parked, by the town library and elementary school, it stopped following me. I tried to find anyone who may have had similar encounters in the area, but all I could find was old legends of the Rougarou; which is pronounced, “Rue-Ga-Rue.” I told my grandpa about what had happened, but told him it was a friend who had told me it happened to him. I also told him that it sounded like a crazy story to me. He told me when he was 17, in the same area, at night, hunting, he heard a howl like nothing he had ever heard before. He also told me that something had stalked him, as he ran home that night. He said he never saw what it was, but could hear it following him through the brush and swamps. That encounter has changed my life. My perception of what is real and what is not will never be the same again. I still haven't gotten over that night. I went back a few days after that incident and found 2 large dog tracks, as big as my hand. I wear a size LG glove."
Louisiana,LA,Rapides Parish,-92.539603,31.1461104,,"June 1987 - I was 14 years old and lived in Central Louisiana, at the time. My mother had always been interested in the Paranormal. She’d buy copies of UFO magazine and watch documentaries on Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, etc. So, I just grew up being interested in things like that, at face value. I always believed in them, but I never had any inkling that werewolves, Dogmen or whatever could possibly exist. ??Anyway; I lived in a mobile home park, which was on a two lane highway. Highway 28 East, to be exact. It was a long street, with a cul-de-sac type of dead end. At the dead end, to the left was the only brick home in the park. Straight ahead, was thin woods and several trails going off in every direction. To the right, slightly, was a deep ditch, that people had dumped junk and trash in, like old washing machines, broken laundry baskets or what have you. A thin, metal wire fence ran from the ditch, across, into the woods and out of sight. We (the kids in the neighborhood) had what we called a ""Club,"" where we would all gather, to hang out. Some of us had gathered busted or discarded dining room chairs and placed them in the center of what was the thinnest area of trees. I had come there to figure out where to put everything. Beyond the deep ditch, further into the woods, was a small stream, with hills on each side. An enormous old oak tree had fallen beside the stream, on the side I was on. I spotted an old metal folding table, near the stream and went down to inspect it. I thought it would be a good item to put in the center of the chairs. It seemed to be in good condition, so I decided to head home. I figured I’d get it the next morning.The next morning, I made my way toward the metal wire fence, which somehow (I don't know why) had been bent, on both its top and bottom, inwards (toward the center of the fence). I was about to duck under it, when I heard the distinct sound of sniffing, so I turned to see what it was. Standing on the other side of the stream was a 7 to 8 foot tall creature, sniffing the air. Its head was turned slightly. The first thought that entered my mind was, ""Oh my God! Werewolves are real!"" It stood on two, powerfully built, muscular legs, which ended in enormous paws. It had no tail. It had a massive chest, as well as extremely muscular arms and hands. The hands seemed to have the same kind of pads that a paw has, but they were arranged differently. It had a wolf-like head and tall, pointed ears. The eyes glowed red. The ears were in proportion to the head. It had a snout or muzzle. It kept sniffing the air as it stepped OVER the tree trunk like it was nothing. I would have had to physically climb it, to get over it. I thought it was coming after me. It stopped and seemed to be breathing or panting, but there was this deep, rumble that accompanied it. I decided to get out of there, before it did see me and ducked up under the fence. I ran to my bike which was parked off the road and peddled my butt home. I never went into those woods again, after that. About a month and a half, to two months later, we moved to Mississippi. It wasn’t until many years later that I discovered the term, ""Dogmen."" It scared me, but also started me on my fascination with ancient myths, legends, werewolves and many other non-Bigfoot cryptids."

There are poultry farms located east of shreveport. In november of 2017 there have been incidents of dogman encounters on this farm. the footprints, dead chickens -sightings and even the farmers shooting at the creature with shotguns, rifles and pistols-video was taken by one of the overseers on duty, what is bad ..is that there are several other farms over the area that have had these werewolf encounters and its bad for business!!we must have the wildlife agents deal with tracking them to their lair of residence and terminating the damn things!! the frequency of incidents is more and more...these farmers are not in the mood to have their lives torn by these dogmen and unless dealt with now...they will do more damage, as far as being broadcast to the general public about these demons and their doings....they are not informed and the capers that prevail are unchecked by most area farmers and residents, *this story should be a wake up call for the law enforcement community and the area farmers as well as the citizens to make a stand against these werwolf-dogman encounters.

Georgia,GA,Habersham County,-83.5496566,34.6478893,,"September 2015 - This took place 3 weeks ago, while driving home from an event, with my fiancé. It was already dark out and was raining, when we hit the road this night. I, myself, was driving and my fiancé was in the passanger seat. We had been driving about 15 minutes, at most, when we got to a part of the road where I had noticed a rather large figure, in the opposite lane of the 2-way road, we were on. It seemed to be on all 4‘s and was greyish in color. It was very quick, which was startling, given the conditions. I asked my fiancé if she had seen it. She said “Yes,” but seemed spooked about it. I wanted to stop, but couldn’t, because there was another car, about 100 feet behind us. I also didn't look back, because I wanted to stay focused, on the road, because of the poor conditions and the fact that we were in an area we never had been in, until that night. I truly don't think it was a cow, from what i saw, even with the fleeting glimpse I had of it. Its hair was more K9 like, than anything. I would have to conclude that it was a Dogman or a Bigfoot. I definitely wish I would have been able to get a longer look at it, during the daytime. It was within feet of my door, but because it happened so quickly and the fact I kept my focus on the road, instead of turning to look at it, I didn’t see it clearly. That’s pretty much my encounter, to a tee"
Georgia,GA,Buck Shoals State Park,-83.6308524,34.5570716,,"This will be a brief summary because if I wrote most of the entire encounter here, well, way too long. On July 4, 2016 just a few days ago now, two girlfriends and myself decided to raft down the Chattahoochee River and spend time at the diving rock and laugh at all the drunks enjoying their holiday. This is a North Georgia summer tradition going way back to the sixties. I am 47 now but in my youth I did it quite a few times and damn near killed myself doing a gainer off the diving rock when I landed on my belly, inhaled water somehow and nearly drowned. I was fairly drunk and don't remember how I made it back to the surface but my upper body was purple the next day and my internal organs hurt for weeks. The river was way down that year (maybe 1988) so that made the big flat rock at least 25 feet high off the river. Most people chickened out once they got up there. Anyhow, so this past Monday After at least 28 years we were back but sober now since I haven't drank alcohol in over ten years. I had to answer the call of nature (#2) so I had to walk very far back into the dense woods because of all the people (15 or so) waiting to jump. Having nothing but my bathing suit, I walked much further so I could try and find something akin to toilet tissue. Finally, after I reached a small clearing surrounded by old growth pines, I began my business. As I am squatting in a very vulnerable position, out walks in broad daylight an enormous canine type creature. I spent 21 years in Army, all over the world and three different theaters of war and I have never even heard of this creature before. In the three days since, I have barely slept at all, researching everything in a zombified state. I can still taste the fear in my throat and my own vomit. I am six foot tall and about 250 solid pounds and this thing dwarfed me. At least 7 foot 6 and maybe 350-400 pounds. As a former college and semi pro football player and powerlifter, I know about big people and about strength and musculature and this was no normal creature that evolved somehow in that environment. This is some kind of genetically mixed entity of man, wolf and primate. My encounter with it lasted for minutes, it displayed very bizarre behavior and vocalized several times at me. It stunk so bad and horrified me so badly that I wretched again and again. I was gone so long that the girls came looking for me and they are what finally scared it off. When they found me, I was trembling and couldn't speak. As a combat life saver in the Army, I can tell you for certain that I was in shock from this. Every joint in my body and my ab muscles are still hurting after three days. So, I will be more than willing to share everything with you in the hopes that I can relieve my anxiety somewhat by just expressing my trauma. Because, I'm not sure what type I saw, but I can promise you that this is not something that anyone would want to encounter twice. I am not grateful, I don't feel privileged and I will not chase after this thing with a camera. Give me a call if you want and leave me a text if I cant answer because I work different hours than most, thanks for providing a forum for us experiencers, I need it."
Mississippi,MS,Hancock County,-89.5120084,30.3887582,,"This occurred in early December, 2011 at around 2 A.M. in the morning. A friend and I were sitting in my bedroom hanging out whenever we both noticed something moving on my surveillance monitor. I had a camera pointed down my driveway so I could see whenever I had company drive up. When we both looked, I saw what appeared to be a large canine running on all fours and in mid run this thing came up on its hind legs and continued running across my field and across my drive and into my brothers field on two legs. I was in shock and my friend immediately turned to me with her mouth wide open. I asked her, ""What did you just see!?"" and she replied with ""Well what did you see!?"" I saw where this was going so I then asked her, ""How many legs was it running on!?"" She replied, ""It was running on four but went to two!"" I then had a cold chill run through my body as I knew she saw what I had seen. I jumped up and grabbed my night vision scope I had recently purchased and ran to my front door with my friend behind me. I must admit I was hesitant to open that door for fear of it maybe standing there. So I opened the door while letting out a ""roar"" as to maybe shock it if it was there, but it wasn't. Hey, I didn't know! I cautiously walked out on my front porch and took the scope and scanned the front field. There was nothing to be see nor do I know which direction it went in besides where I had seen it last. I waited until daybreak and went out to where it crossed my driveway and I found a paw print that was a good 12""x12"". I was stunned. I just stood there looking back at the woods it had came from and looked South to where it was headed. I had no way to save the print and didn't think to take a picture at the time, nor was my camera recording at the time of the sighting either. From what I could see on camera, this thing was massive in its upper body. I can still remember seeing the muscles flexing and the muscularity in its upper back as it came to its full height. It was running in weeds that came to my waist but on all fours it was a good two feet above them and when it went to full height I would estimate it to be a good 8 foot tall. Due to the camera showing only B & W I didn't get to see its color but it was dark. Its head is something else that stands out as I could see the snout and its pointed ears which were laid back whenever it went to two legs. I am a R&D technician so I am trained to watch for details and even though this thing was moving fast, faster than any human, I was transfixed on its form and what I was seeing. It was headed South and into property that connects to the Stennis Space Center's Buffer Zone which is over a 100,000 acres of untouched and uninhabited acreage that was put aside for the Space Shuttle Program in Hancock County, MS since the mid 60's. So it has all the resources it needs in order to survive in those woods and to go undetected. I have always been an outdoors man but since that sighting, I will not go out in the woods without a gun on me now. I know for a fact I do not want to run into that thing up close"
Missouri,MO,Chesterfield,-90.5770675,38.6631083,,"I saw three of them, eating something big and bloody, in a field. They saw me, stopped eating, and followed me back to the farm when I got out of there.
This happened more than fifty years ago. It was forbidden to talk about, in the family, lest the neighbors think we were cracked pots. Now, all the old folks are gone and I’ve told my children about what I saw that day. They said I should write it down, but I think I’ll leave that up to them to do.
There were other strange things going on in the area, but at the time, we didn’t connect them together. If the aunts and uncles did know what was going on, they wouldn’t tell us kids. It’s been cathartic to talk about and I’m so pleased to see that others have seen them too, but I have to tell you, to think back on something I’ve tried to forget, for over fifty years, is terrible. It was so frightening, I haven’t been able to get a good night’s sleep; thinking back on all that gore and those things faces. I truly believe they would have eaten me if they hadn’t already just eaten.
When I finally told where and what had happened, I was called a bald-faced liar and given a good beating. Then, the folks went to the field and to the truck that I hid in and saw the gore, blood, scratches, prints, and all. Later, an uncle up the road, about five miles, had these prints come up to his house. He took pictures of them and there was a newspaper article about some sort of huge cat, prowling around. I don’t know if that has anything to do with those critters or not.
A neighboring farm that was owned by a wealthy family, compared to us, had a prized bull go missing. I bet that had something to do with those things. He was a huge thing and very ornery. They never found a trace.
I know this is choppy and not very clear, but it still makes me nervous to talk about it, after all this time.

Something big crossed the road
Dogman Sighting details::
It was about 2 years ago, I was going up to my Mother in laws house to pick up my husband after him and his brother had finished working on his jeep. It was already dark, I was coming up the back way to her house which is mostly all gravel roads through farm land. I had just gotten off the black top and passed a big farm when this thing jumped from one side of the creep behind the farm across the road in front of me to the other side which was a field and woods. I stopped the car, first I thought maybe it was a donkey, but it was too big and fast, and the tail on it looked more like a dog. I tried to make sense of it, it was grey so it wasn't a deer or cow, and it wasn't a horse. There were no hoof beats, it was quiet and fast! I haven't seen anything again but there have been reports of dogs missing and killed, also the farm where this thing came from used to have cows, but now they don't have them anymore. This is from HawkPoint MO, by Troy MO. Thanks for listening, if you have further questions shoot me an email!

Dogman in Missouri
Dogman Sighting details::
Almost 3 years ago now, it was almost fall. I was heading up to get my husband from his mothers house about an hour away from where we live. It was dark, the road had just turned into a gravel road. There is woods on one side, and a creek and commercial farm on the other side. This dark gray thing came from the creek side and jumped across the road, I could make out it's back end but definitely saw a tail like a dogs. I told him and his mom that I saw a donkey running across the road in front of me, but the tail looked like a dogs tail. I get laughed at for it. But I did stop my car and get out to look for the animal thinking someone had lost a pet. A car pulled up but kept going, I was hoping they would stop and ask me what was going on, but that didn't happen. I stood there for a couple of seconds and thought that it was a dumb idea, a lot of horror movies start out like that after all. But that was the full extent of that sighting. However I had another strange thing happen on a camping trip that I took with my husband and some friends down to Meremac Springs Caverns in Missouri if you want to hear about that one. It is short just the same but after seeing what I saw by his moms house, I wondered how close I came to danger that night as well.

Missouri,MO,Pulaski County,-92.2236667,37.8727481,,"Date Unknown - I should start off explaining that my partner and I are experienced Bigfoot investigators who are in a unique situation, as we have a family group living in our research area. Last October, during the full moon, my partner and I were on our ""Hilltop"" having quite a bit of success with two juveniles and one adult (that we noticed). We could hear them walking in the leaf litter and every once in a while we could also hear a clack or wood knock from different directions. After a while, it seemed the feeling of ""fun"" for them dissipated and became a lot more cautious. Mike heard something to our north and went a ways down to investigate while I stayed by the camp, to make sure it wasn't a diversion. He came back in a rush and said he had seen one of the young ones come out of the wood line, running for the other side of the fire break, and what was following, he said he couldn't comprehend. It was about 6 ft tall, with pointy ears, and a long snout. At this point, I have to say that neither of us have given any creed to the ""Dogman/Wolfman/Grassman"" theory. We just thought it was mistaken identification of a Bigfoot or a bear. I had purchased a .40cal. handgun (and some hydro-shock ammunition for it) earlier that day, so it was in my vehicle. After Mike had explained what he had seen, I retrieved my weapon and loaded it. All the while, we could hear the two young ones chattering and the big one stomping all to our backside. They were pissed or upset about something and they never acted that way with us. I had Mike take me down the fire break to where he saw this creature and with spotlights we scanned the area. We could here something moving around and a few short growls. Finally Mike caught it with the spot light going between trees and what I witnessed is something I never would have dreamed of seeing, except on a movie screen. A 6 ft wolf, walking on its hind legs!!! I fired my weapon in the air and it turned to the south east, into the woods. We cautiously made our way back to camp, but we could hear this thing pacing us to our left. As we got back to camp, we kept listening to this thing approaching us from the woods. Mike turned on the spotlight and I leveled my gun wherever the sound was coming from. It was approaching us without fear and it felt to both of us like it was stalking us, as it was one of our juvies that Mike had witnessed. It came out from between the trees and I shot it square in the ribs at about 20 yards (We measured the next day and I am a VERY good shot)! I saw the wound and know without a doubt I hit it. It fell to the ground, but immediately got up and ran to the south east. We could hear it crash through the brush, and we even heard it fall down or trip over something, but it continued to head in pretty much a southerly direction, down the hill, paralleling the fire break. We were both freaked by this time, and broke camp, and left. The next morning, I loaded up a few extra clips and we went back up to see if it died somewhere close, or was just wounded, so we felt we had to track it down. We did track it from the point of where I shot it, all the way down the canyon and even found where it made such a ruckus when it fell. The leaf litter was all up ended and was fairly easy to track. At one point, we did find a perfect K-9 track in a mud ridge, but it was over 8 inches across. the thing that absolutely baffled both of us was that there was no blood trail. NONE!!! We both saw the bullet hit, yet no blood?!? We tracked it all the way down the canyon, until we lost the trail. We talked to a Native American couple we know and they immediately said ""Skin Walker."" We contacted a few other Investigators, to try and figure out what in the hell happened. I mentioned before, that neither of us took any creed from any Dogman reportings, but... I do know that neither of us wants to experience it again, and I have NEVER gone out in the woods unarmed since."
Missouri,MO,St. Louis County,-90.4125181,38.6103023,11/19/2015,"11/19/2015 - I was rolling the trash cans out, for pick up the next day. It was late, so I grabbed a flashlight. I walked out the back door, unlocked the gate, and was dragging the can, while walking backwards. As I passed the fence, it blocked my view of my nieghbors garage. That’s when my light hit this wolf creature. I froze instantly. The creature was about twenty feet away and I could clearly see that it was crouching. When our eyes met, it turned to its right and fell to all fours and leaped my neighbors driveway, in one jump. That driveway is about twelve feet wide. The creature was about eight feet tall and maybe three hundred pounds. It looked kind of thin around the waist, but it was very muscular. I dropped the trash can and panic set in. I ran inside, grabbed my gun, and locked my self in my room. I’ve never felt fear like that before! When the light hit its eyes, they were a vibrant, yellow color. His fur was short and charcoal colored. I could hear the clicking of his claws, when he dropped down, on all fours. I thought I was seeing things. I didn’t sleep a wink that night. It made me really question my sanity. Furthermore; it made me seek a concealed carry weapons permit. Just a few nights ago, I heard something wimpering, when it was just starting to get dark. I slammed my window shut and hit the lights. I layed in bed, with my AR-15 that night."
North Carolina,NC,Cumberland County,-78.7476208,34.9542604,,"On the night I had my brief encounter, it was unusually slow. During slow parts of my night, I park outside the facility I work out of and watch the wildlife. It’s abundant, with a mixture of fox, coyotes, raccoons, and every once in a while, I’ll spy a red wolf breaking the wood line, trotting across an open field, in search of small game. Our facility is located on a dead-end street, which backs up to a major creek and to the left, we have a smaller creek that breaks off of the larger one. Both creeks are fed by a large river, about a mile away. I should also mention that we have large patches of woodland that lead to our facility and that the area does not have a lot of light until you turn into the parking area.
About a week prior to my encounter, I would sit at the end of the road, to complete my paperwork and wait for the next call to come. As I parked there, I would get a sense of being watched. I would look up, almost expecting someone to be standing in front of my truck.
Let me say that darkness or the woods do not spook me or make me jumpy. I was raised in the swamp, close to a river and rather enjoy the solitude. Not only did I have a sense of being watched and sharing my space with someone, I noted that there were no normal night sounds, such as crickets and frogs. I also found it baffling that all the wildlife seemed to be gone from the area. This really bothered me. I couldn’t figure it out.
On the night I had my encounter, I decided to leave some wet dog food at the edge of the woodline, hoping to entice a family of raccoons out, so I could at least see that they were okay. This family of raccoons, I had watched grow up from kits and not seeing them bothered me. Also, I didn’t see a gray fox that would hang around that area. This fox would come within four to five feet from you but would be guarded all the while. He would hang out with certain people and then retreat back into the woods. Anyway, I popped the top off of some smelly dog food and as I was pulling the top off the can, I heard a deep growl come from out of the edge of the wood line. I had never heard an animal growl with such force and so deeply. At first, I thought it could have been a Jake brake, from the interstate. That can be heard from our facility but that’s not what it was. I could feel hear it from the woodline, hitting my face and felt the growl inside of my chest, pretty much like a vibration. I knew this was not a bear, the same as someone knows their left hand from their right. You just know. And yes we do have bear here, but I can tell you quite bluntly and very firmly, this was not a bear or any other wildlife that was normal to the area. I dropped my head down and refused to look up. I dumped the can of food on the ground with one hard thump, hoping whatever was in the woodline would rather have the can of food, instead of me. I backed away with my head down until I reached my truck. My instinct told me to drive away and so I did. About half an hour later, I returned, due to my curiosity overruling my common sense. Being a natural skeptic, I was prepared to figure out the earlier event. I parked in the same place and this time had walked to the back of my truck to smoke. While standing there, I observed a dark mass come across the road and disappear into an open field, that is mostly overgrown with wild blackberry bushes and grass. I have a trained eye. I take in a lot of detail, and still, I admit to suffering from short-term memory loss, due to a TBI that ended my law enforcement career. What I saw at that moment, though, will be in my memory forever. I can only describe this creature as what I took at the time to be some kind of a hybrid. Although it was on all fours, to me, it did not appear natural. It moved with very quick, fluent motions. Looking back, I was most surprised by the creature having the intelligence to attempt to appear natural. Something was off with its gate, though. It was kind of like the front legs were pulling its body forward. The back was hunched at the shoulders and it had a long back. The creature was black, which I can only describe as a dark mass, with no reflection. I also noted it had a small animal in its mouth. The strange part was that I could see the definition of most of the small animal, compared to the darkness of the creature that I now believe to be a Dogman. The snout was long but fit its body. What struck me most were its ears. They were folded back like you might see on a Dutch Shepherd or German Shepherd. I guess, with my background, working with dogs, the ears were clearly defined to me. I can’t say what kind of tail it had or what color its eyes were. I just know it was there one minute and gone the next. When daylight came, I looked for tracks, but listened to my gut and did not enter the field looking for it. The ground leading out of the smaller creek was covered in grass and what dirt was there was hard. I was left baffled but more amazed than anything. I sat on my experience for several months. I didn’t tell anyone about it. I then started searching the internet for what I had seen. I guess, in my mind, I wondered if it was some type of hybrid created by man and had escaped. I found several sites on the internet, but none seemed to come close to what I had seen. Nothing until I came across a picture of a Dogman. If you take what I saw and stand it upright, instead of being on all fours, well Vic, that’s what I saw. With a doubt. I’m pretty sure this Dogman was a young adult but it wasn’t overly massive. What I ponder the most is the fact the Dogman had to catch my scent before clearing the woodline. I know scent. I know how it works. The Dogman knew I was there before coming out of the woods. I suppose that will be the answer I will never have.
After a few months of keeping my experience to myself, I spoke with a few of my co-workers. Of course, they told me it was a bear or a large wolf, but they did acknowledge that the wildlife had disappeared for a while. I was told to share my story but I think it was only so my co-worker could get a good laugh at me behind my back.
I stand by what I saw, although I don’t speak about it much, because of people like him. I did reach out to you a few months ago and you kindly responded back. For that, I thank you. I have never been fascinated by Bigfoot or other similar creatures ( although I did
respond to a Bigfoot call, off the record, for a law enforcement friend) but at this point, I am consumed with what I saw that morning and learning more about it. I am grateful that you are around, for support, for people like me. Thank you for allowing me to share my encounter. As I write this, I am once again on night shift, parked at the same spot where I had my encounter. I’m pretty sure that Dogman has left the area. Wildlife is back and the night sounds are all around. I guess I will always wonder if it will come back again, but I can’t say I will ever walk the woods at night again, looking for animal tracks by myself.

North Carolina,NC,Robeson County,-79.1096901,34.6383858,,"July 1990 - I was around 9 years old or so and was at my mom's friend’s house, because they were having a little get together. My mom’s best friend, at the time, decided to go get something, which was at a house nearby, down a dirt road, in the woods. My mom’s friend decided to take my friend and me with her. I wish I had never gone with her. We rode with her, over there and when she got out, my friend and I stayed in her car and waited for her to come back. After sitting in her car for 10 minutes, we decided to get out, to see what was taking her so long. When we did that, she told us to get back in the car, so we did. As it turned out, she was buying weed, so we weren’t welcome in the house. So, my buddy and I got back in her car and waited for her to come out. They had a lot of bulldogs at that property. The dogs had all been barking, like crazy, and then just stopped, all at once and went into their dog houses. That’s when my friend and I saw this thing that looked like some kind of Werewolf, coming from behind the car. We froze and just stared at it, as it walked by. Wow! It looked so demonic! When we saw it, we ducked down and laid on the floor boards. We laid there for what seemed like forever, until we heard my mom’s friend hitting on the driver’s window, trying to get us to let her in. I guess it left when it heard her come out of the house or something."
Tennessee,TN,Jefferson County,-83.4643551,36.0417825,,"2012 - I'd like to tell you about the encounter my son had, maybe 4 years ago. He told me about it then, but I had no clue. Now we have Dogman Encounters and now I know. Here's what happened. My son's friend was driving him home, about 11PM, through a rural, residential area. The houses are spaced some distance apart. They were on a 2 lane highway, with no street lights, and very little traffic. The area is not overly wooded, but has patches of trees and fields. This area would probably be included in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains. Anyway, they were driving along, when suddenly, from the right side of the road, this ""thing"" sprang out, and was across the road, and into the bushes on the other side, in two leaps, or bounds, or steps, or however you want to say it. It was in full view, because of their headlights. My son said the first thing he thought was ""dog"". He went on to say that it was running on all-fours, like a deer. He said it was the color of a deer, with a huge dog head, massive shoulders, and a really small waist. He kept repeating how big it was, so I asked for a comparison. I asked if he meant huge like maybe a big deer or was it maybe as tall as a cow. He answered and I can quote his answer, ""Mom, this thing was massive. If we had hit it, the car would have gone underneath it and it's body would have hit the windshield."" I don't remember what kind of car it was, but it was about the size and shape of one of those older Sentras. He said that neither he or his friend said anything for about 10 seconds and then his friend yelled ""Did you see that?"" My son said yes and they didn't say another word the rest of the way. And that's it. It's really creepy to me and I thought other listeners like might to hear about it."
Tennessee,TN,Hamilton County,-85.1479364,35.1618966,,"Date Unknown - Laugh at me. I really don't care. I don't know what I saw. It looked like a cross between a guy and a wolf (I sh*t you not)! I was on my way home from work. I was maybe 10 minutes from the house, coming up a big hill. I suddenly got the strangest feeling, so I slowed down, thinking a deer was gonna come out of the woods, or something. I just felt like I was being watched, or followed. There were no cars in front of me, or behind me. I got to the top of the hill and slammed on my brakes, because as soon as I got to the top of the hill, this HUGE, black, hairy thing came bounding across the road!!! It was so big, when it ran, its back arched up, kind of like a cheetah, but only a lot more than that. I know that if it would have stood up, it would have been well over 6 feet tall, maybe taller!!! I also know another car saw it too, because when I hit the brakes, another car turned onto that road and slammed on their brakes too. We both just sat there for a few minutes (not really safe considering; I know...but, I was in shock). I truly have no idea what it was that I saw. It was NOT a dog or a horse. Dogs do NOT get that big or arch their backs like this thing did when it was running. The arms, legs, whatever it had, were so long, it was having to throw them out to the side (think crab-walk) just to run. And the...appendages...it had were just as big as it was. It ran from one side of the woods to the other, non-stop, like it was either going after something, or running away from something. I honestly have no idea what the holy freaking hell it was that I saw. I don't care if you laugh at me. I know what I saw. "
Tennessee,TN,Shelby County,-89.9253233,35.1268552,,"Date Unknown - Just thought I would report this as a potential Dogman hearing, not sighting. Multiple co-workers of mine in a Shelby County, TN, medical facility have heard a strange creature screaming/making crystal clear sounds behind facility. It is well lit, fenced, but there are woods behind and also a river bottom near. 3 separate people have heard the noise, 2 together, 1 at an earlier time, last summer. This most recent event happened within the last month. When discussing it, the 3rd person confided that they had also heard the noise in the pre-dawn house, while getting something from their vehicle and couldn't believe it so they had never mentioned it to anyone. After hearing the details of what the other two heard, the third person confided. All three are medical professionals, have outdoor experience and could not identify the creature making the sounds. The described it as being loud, crystal clear, and even though it was from an obvious distance, the call was loud enough to be heard clearly, from within a running car, with defroster blowing. This occurred at twilight, near 6-7am. Also, since this occurred near shift change, there were several ladies coming in to work, who obviously heard the noise too and rushed inside the building, as observed by the two who were leaving. "
Virginia,VA,Camden County,-76.3804983,36.5565408,,"Date Unknown - My step dad lived in Virginia when he was around the age of 8. Right on the edge of ""The Great Dismal Swamp."" According to him, he was in bed one night when the sky was cloudless, or just very bright (he never thought until recently whether the moon was shining, or not) and saw a beast looking right through his window at him. He said, he could see spittle running down its face and its eyes were looking straight at him. It was supposedly standing on its hind legs and had cream, red, and brown-colored, matted fur and a face almost like a wolf. Other than its snout, its facial features were very human. Its jaw bones were high, the structure around its eyes and its eyes themselves were human-esq. The coloring of its eyes, he believes, were yellow. The reason why I think this is interesting and possibly valid is because, the Great Dismal Swamp covers a huge amount of territory and is hardly touched by humans. Only in recent years have people started to study its inhabitants. The grounds are wet, mossy, and absorb sound. And people have been known to wander into it and never return. Who knows what could be lurking in the unknown... Chills my bones! Oh, yeah! I forgot to mention that he crawled out of his bed and went straight to his mother's room. In the morning, when they looked around the house, all the windows had ground that was stirred up under them and grass that was yanked out. There were actual scratches in the wood under his window, and paint was missing too. However; as far as they could see, there were no discernable footprints."
West Virginia,WV,Hancock County,-80.5660657,40.5123559,,"2002 - I’m a 32 year old lady, from the very northern tip of West Virginia. Most of my life has been lived in Hancock County. When I was little, we camped in tents, walked everywhere, hiked at parks; all that outside goodness. In my teens, we started going to state parks, to ride horses. I’ve been to Tomilson Run, Beaver Creek State Park, Salt Fork, Raccoon Creek, and Vista Park (I think that was the name). We had a friend who was constantly inviting us to ride on peoples’ land she had received permission from. I’m well acquainted with the local wildlife. I’ve seen all the major players, including coydogs, and bears, and can identify most sounds in the forest. I love watching nature documentaries. I was looking to become a vet, so I studied a lot, on animals. Drawing and painting them got me very acquainted with animal anatomy. Was I ever into cryptozoology? Yes! I was a dino-crazy, little girl. My one babysitter had Reader’s Digest ‘Mysteries of the Unexplained’. The thought of a plesiosaur, in Scotland or an Apatosaurus, in the Congo, was just mind blowing. Later in life, I started looking at it like Folklore. It was interesting to read the accounts and learn the theories behind what people were seeing, but I believed in them as much as a folklorist believes in dragons and trolls. I didn’t have any interest in Bigfoot and I’d never heard of Dogmen. I never had interest in looking, nor did the thoughts ever cross my mind. It seems I didn’t need to go looking, they found me. We moved to the farm when I was about 10. Mom’s dream was to have horses and she was finally able to live it. The farmhouse was haunted, mainly by the former residents of the house. I never felt threatened by them though. It's a little unnerving to have two men talking and moving the couch you’re sitting on. Or should I say, it sounded like it. No one was home, no media was on, and yet, I was hearing two men, talking about how they were going to move the couch, and where, and the sound of furniture being dragged, right from under me. The land, itself, had its share of strangeness. Most things were benign though. We just shrugged and carried on. I honestly hated our woods. Anywhere else, I’d freely hike, but even in the yard, sometimes I felt watched. Heck, sometimes I thought something was staring in our windows. Now that I think of it, we did have things slam into our trailer. I'd think it was a horse that had gotten loose, but when I'd go out, to investigate, I'd find nothing. I'd chalk it up to a deer. I used my horses' breeds for their names, rather than think up names for them. Anyone who knows me knew my horses' names. I was eighteen to nineteen, in this encounter. By this time, we gave up on cows (I hate, hate, hate them) and just had the horses and chickens. Someone knocked on the door, at 2am. I'd only been asleep two hours, but years of conditioning had my heart pumping and my mind clearing. Someone knocking that early meant trouble. It usually meant horses or livestock had gotten out. I wasn't disappointed. Our neighbor said the horses were in his yard. My mind wasn't totally awake, so I didn't think to ask which yard they were in. My stepfather came out, asked what was up, and told me they were my horses, so deal with it. Mom was working. That was nothing new. This lot of horses had three expert escape artists. I had the routine down. It was pretty dark out, but I did have some moonlight, to help. The security light only went so far. Then of course, it shut off, after so long. When it was cloudy, you literally had to watch that you didn't walk off, into the ravine, it was so pitch. I was naturally in a foul mood, cursing my horses, and wondering if some drunk had gone through the fence, AGAIN. It happened a lot. As I got closer to the brown barn, I realized a horse was flipping out. It was running back and forth, squealing, and carrying on. I went in and grabbed the halters and leads. I paused for a moment, to see if any other horse or horses had replied to the horse I heard squeal. That would give me an idea where the other horse or horses might be. There was no reply. That was odd. I was thinking, ""Crap! They're on the other side of the hill!"" It was the only reason in my mind they wouldn't be replying. Let's just say, when they followed our cut trails, to the other side, it took us an hour to traverse through the woods and lead them back. And even with two guys, on a four wheeler, and my mom, that was a freaky trek. I felt like I was being watched and followed. Maybe, it wasn't paranoia. So, the land is set up like this. The brown barn was connected to a small pasture, about half an acre long; which then connects to a seven acre pasture. Pretty much in the center, on the outside edge of the large pasture, was an old, white barn, that we turned into a run-in. I decided to tackle the horse still in the fence, so I could bring her down to the small pasture, to keep her from escaping too. Maybe, the others would follow. I had to walk clear to the other side of the pasture, to get to the panicking horse. It was my mother's psycho appaloosa mare. I tried to catch her and nearly got trampled, a few times trying. She was frothing at the mouth and her eye whites were REALLY showing! Was I alarmed? No. As I said, psycho! I noticed my other six were across the road. They were standing in a tiny, little fenced-in area, under a spotlight. They were standing motionless and not touching a blade of grass. I was wondering how the neighbor managed to herd them into that tiny fenced in area, with that tiny door. Three of those horses were over sixteen hands tall. One was a draft horse-cross. The doorway was actually small enough; he touched both sides, going through. My Thoroughbred mare took me two hours to corral, the last time she got out (much to my frustration, she was an awesome jumper). So, a stranger rounding them up and putting them into a tiny yard was mind-blowing. I've had horses since I was nine. I'm thirty two now. I've had ponies and horses. I've had appaloosas, Arabians, draft horses, quarterhorses, walking horses, saddlebreds, thoroughbreds, mustangs, foals, geldings, mares, and geldings that still thought they were stallions. I've had a lot of horses, from all walks of life. I will tell you, they consistently do not like to be crammed into tight spaces, especially, not in a group. I had two severely abused horses, I was rehabbing, a thoroughbred that actually had PTSD, and a racking horse, that actually took me three years to touch, without some sort of a bad reaction. They did not like being in stalls, and all but one were mares. Mares are extremely moody and two of mine were particularly vicious, to those they didn't like. My walker mare only liked three other horses. She should have been kicking the crap out of the others there. Mine also didn't like to be under lights, when they escaped. They avoided them like the plague. And not eating grass, that was over ankle deep? That was unheard of. They were silent and dead still. My neighbor came out and told me that they were like that when he found them. He asked me if I needed help, but I said, ""No."" My thoroughbred and racking horse mares did not like men. I told him I'd take them out, one at a time. I took one halter and lead and threw the rest outside the gate. I put the halter on my gelding and opened the gate, to lead him out. They had other plans though. All six came out, as a freaking unit. They were literally chest to butt, crammed together. My gelding and my Welsh mare had their chest pushing against me as we walked back to the brown barn. Normally, they did not do this. I wouldn't usually allow such bad behavior. We were on the main road, which I did not like. The speed limit is only thirty five, but people go sixty. So, I tried to lead them through the large pasture gate. They wouldn't even go on that side of the road though. I was a little unnerved, by their behavior. So I lead them down to the brown barn and they went in. They were skittish though, picking at the hay I threw out, walking around restlessly, sticking to the barn like glue, and eyeing the upper pasture. I rationalize it by thinking, it's the appy flipping out, that's unnerving them. And why hadn't she come down yet? She had to have seen us all walk down. I rushed to the gate, between the little and big pastures, out of habit. I didn't want the herd to go back out, into the big pasture. I didn't have to worry. They didn't follow me (like they usually did). The gate was wide open, but the appy was still running and squealing, back and forth, in the same area. I started to go get her. Now, the neighbors' security lights didn't really light up my pasture. The road was higher than my pasture, so it was cast, in a shadow. I could make out her shape and some detail though. She took off, at a panicked gallop, swerved sideways, and jumped the stream. When she landed, she nearly landed on her face. She caught herself though and took off, at a dead gallop, again. I ducked behind a stump. If she would of hit me, I would have been dead. I went back and chained the gate. I decided to forego looking her over, until I got the halters and leads. She was too hot at the moment. I decided to walk on the road, instead of through the pasture, again. The pasture was uneven, unlit, and full of springs. Sometime, during this, clouds had taken over the sky. so there was no moonlight, to see by. The spot, on the road, where I was at, was paved and pretty well lit though (my neighbor was paranoid as mentioned). I had almost gotten to the white barn, when I got this sudden urge, to stop and look at a very specific spot, in the pasture. I would like to say, it was instinct that told me to look, but usually, I’d scan the woods first, to see what was watching me. That’s usually where the watchers are. Instead, I just flicked on my flashlight, right on a certain spot. It was extremely close to where the mare was flipping out. I saw red eye shine. My first thought was, ""Why in the world would a deer be there, with all that chaos?"" I was feeling a sense of extreme dread and didn't know why. Besides, it being where my horse was going nuts, told me, something else just wasn't right..... I then realized, where the eyes were, relative to the walnut trees and my racing barrels. See; the road is above the pasture and the walnut trees were right at the same elevation, as the road. The pasture itself is sloped, to deal with the runoff, from the road. The barrel, it was next to, was on the low end of the incline. The barrels were white, so I could see a dim lighting (from my flashlight) on the one it was next to. This thing was too freaking big to be a deer. I was frozen, standing there, watching it. I just had this feeling, it was evil and that I had to keep track of those eyes. It was watching me. It slowly blinked a few times. it also looked over, into the woods, above the pasture. I know you ask your guests if they ever feel there are other ones out there. Well, let me tell you, it crossed my mind. With a sinking stomach, I flashed my flashlight over the woods, to see if I would catch eyeshine. I didn't see any though. So, I went right back to the eyes. They were still there. I flicked back and forth, making sure nothing was sneaking up on me. I don't know how long I stood there, watching, frozen. Someone could have come around the bend and hit me, with their car, I was so focused. Finally, it started to move off. It glanced at me, sideways, a few times (only one eye). I think it went into the copse of trees, around the creek. I heard nothing. That wasn't surprising though. The horses were still restless and making noises. I stood there, a long time after, looking for eye shine. I was wondering if it could have been a bear. I didn’t think so though. The eyes were consistent, in height, until it disappeared. Bears are clumsy, on their back legs. On this uneven, inclined ground, I have no doubt a bear would have dropped to the ground, to go on all fours. Even the rear up and drop down behavior bears do, when they’re trying to see something, wouldn’t work. We had one cross our pasture before. He made a lot of noise, going through the woods. The horses settled down quicker with the bear. I was almost to my neighbor's, at this point. I considered leaving the couple, hundred dollars of tack, at his house (halters and leads aren't cheap). I had no doubt, if I left them there, they'd be gone in the morning. My mother would be pissed. So, I darted over, grabbed them, and ran like a bat out of hell! I know, I know. I should have left the tack. I also know, you're not supposed to run, but I couldn't even conceive what I had just seen. I got into the barn, threw the tack down, and hung with the horses. I wasn't going to go back up that pitch black driveway, on foot. I figured, with the horses, I'd have a warning, and the barn had plenty of sharp things. I didn't go back up, until dawn. I was frozen stiff by that time. I've had years to think this over. It unnerves the crap out of me. How long was that thing there? Was that what was keeping the appy mare from coming down? Was it RIGHT there, in the shadows, while I was trying to catch her or was it in the unlit barn, I walked through, to get to the road? Was It the reason the appy swerved and nearly fell? How did my horses get out? I never did find how they got out. Did they panic and jump the fence? I did check the fence line, away from the woods. I did look for tracks, around the barrel. Sadly, the ground was hard, from frost that morning. But, I will say, the appy mare was running for a good while. The ground was severely torn up and turned into a muddy, mess (it was high noon when I went down there, to check, and the ground had melted). I'll bet it was her, that woke the neighbor up. It took them about a week, to fully settle. I don't know if whatever it was was still in the area or if they were that traumatized. It wasn’t too long after that, my mother filed for divorce. My (ex)stepfather got the farm and I moved in with her, in the city. Even with all of the weird crap going on there (there were non-bipedal things going on too), I miss it terribly. Maybe it’s more accurate to say, I miss the farm life rather than the actual place. I’d love to get back onto a farm again, but I’d probably hesitate to move back there. I never told anyone about the eye shine event. I didn’t see the actual creature and really, how do you convey that unnatural/horror inducing feeling? You saw eye shine, whoop-dee-doo. My mother would have given me the benefit of the doubt, but my mother often told family members things. They made my life enough of a living hell. I didn’t want to give them more ammo."
Pennsylvania,PA,Bucks County,-75.2479061,40.4107964,,"2007 and 2010 - My husband was on his way to work around 4 AM, on a rural road, while rounding an “s” bend when his headlights hit a large, dark-brown figure that was sitting about 30 feet off the road, watching the road. He described the figure as about 4 ft tall sitting with legs bent out in front of it. Wolf like face, large pointed ears, (does not remember eye shine) leaning back on human-like arms . My husband immediately felt endangered and floored his vehicle’s accelerator. This man has no fear of humans. I’ve known him for 30 years and have never seen him afraid of a natural being. He’s hunted and fished since childhood. It took him a couple of years before he told me about this sighting. He said his first thought was that thing can catch this car, rip me out and eat me if it wants to.

He was paranoid and had his head on a swivel all that day. Still, to this day, he cannot drive past that location without feeling “some kinda way.”

The second sighting occurred in 2010 and happened to a coworker. I noticed she was acting strangely whenever we talked about spooky things, so I asked her what was up. She said, “Okay. Don’t think I’m crazy.” Then she went on to tell me how one night, she was driving home from a late 2nd shift (between midnight- 1 AM), about 5 or so miles from where the 1st sighting occurred. She had to slow down to a near stop, to turn onto a road that would take her home. That’s when she began to hear what sounded like running alongside her car. That’s when she glanced out her driver’s window and saw the most horrible face. Her 1st thought was “werewolf!” She described it as being black and gray in color, with large teeth. She said she didn’t look again, but could hear it running next to her car until she reached 45-50mph. That’s no joke on a back road. She was scared out of her wits! After arriving home, she ran to the door, dropped the keys, went inside, closed all the curtains, and did not sleep a wink that night.

We’re both nurses and I’ve known her for about 7 years. She grew up in NYC and is not a storyteller. Neither of these people likes to talk about their sightings. You can see a change in them when their encounters are brought up. I don’t need to see one to believe them. I know they exist!"
Pennsylvania,PA,Mercer County,-80.1875065,41.2619821,,"The Shenango Valley, nestled in Mercer County, is a scenic wonder. The tranquil waters of the Shenango Lake belie the fact that a legendary crea-ture may stalk the surrounding countryside. Strange sightings of an un-known animal began to occur around the mid 1950's and continue possibly through the present day. The local residents dubbed this creature the Shenango Valley Werewolf. Margie was walking with her mother and several young friends, when sud-denly from behind her she heard a howling noise. Quickly she turned around and stared in horror as the figure was running toward her on all four legs. When the creature reached her it stood up on its hind legs and grabbed her and started to pull her down the road. Her mother, who was standing several feet in front of her, grabbed Margie's hand and quickly yanked her away from the strange beast. The creature quickly turned and ran back down the gravel road from where it came. The creature was again spotted several days later near an abandoned house at the end of the road where the initial sighting took place. This time the creature was seen to be wearing a blue shirt and pants. The creature, after being observed, quickly ran away into the woods. The creature was dubbed “dog-boy” by the locals in the 1950's – 1970's. Sightings of the creature were rumored to have been seen throughout the area, sometimes it was been by the Shenango Lake, other times, loud howls were heard throughout the area.
 Flash-forward to 2010. Our research group (CUE) Center for Unex-plained Events had a vendor table at a local paranormal conference. The event dubbed MAPS CON (Mysteries and Paranormal Society) was near-ing completion when Margie came over to our table and read the flyer “Have you seen this creature” on the flyer was a depiction of a canid looking werewolf creature. “I saw something strange like that,” Margie stated. We went on to interview her and she explained her encounter. She described the creature as follows; the creature was dark brown, about four feet tall and hair covered over the entire body. One of its' arms appeared to be almost deformed, the hands seemed cloven. The face appeared flat. The one feature that stood out was the eyes, the eyes appeared to sag. When I re-interviewed Margie in 2014, she sketched the creature (see drawing). During her sketching of the creature, she remembered the feelings of dread on seeing this creature. In June of 2014 we went to the location of the sighting in Jefferson Township, Mercer County, PA and photographed the sighting area. The questions remain what did she and all of the other eyewitnesses encounter, a deformed child with hypertri-chosis? (abnormal amount of hair growth over the body – informally called “werewolf syndrome”);was it an unknown cryptid?; was it an interdimensional creature trapped in our realm and unable to travel back to its' own dimension? The phe-nomena then changed course in the 1990's with the next wave of sightings. The creature being observed was much bigger and its appearance was now more wolf-like. 
 The Center for Unexplained Events interviewed an eyewit-ness (who we have now grown to know personally) about a series of en-counters beginning in the spring of 1990. Mark was walking with several friends near where he lived in Mercer County PA when they heard a noise at a nearby park. He shined his flash-light up towards the park when he was startled by what they observed. In the glow of the flashlight stood a huge, dog-like creature that was feeding on an animal, the light made it stand up on its hind legs and turned toward the boys. The creature looked like a man with a dog or more wolf-like face. It quickly ran into the woods, leaving a wet dog-like smell. The boys departed swiftly. The next day they found a deer that was eaten and bro-ken branches about six feet off the ground. 
The next encounter took place the following year in the fall of 1991. The same eyewitness came home from fishing and decided to look for his friends. He drove by an old water company in his neighborhood and found them. They appeared upset and they stated that they had just spot-ted the wolf-like creature again, it had just ran into the woods before Mark arrived at the water company. They drove by an old dirt road close to the water company. Mark shined the spotlight down the road and saw the creature standing by an old utility pole. The creature quickly depart-ed after seeing the light shining in its face and fled back into the wood line. The next day the group went back to the spot looking for evidence. Although they didn't find any physical evidence, the group measured a spike in the utility pole where the creature was standing beside and it measured at 7 feet.
 The creature was described as wolf-like, covered in grayish-white hair and its eyes glowed red. The legend even dating back into the 1950's of the dog-boy seemed to center around the idea that a satanic cult or a coven of witch-es conjured up the creature to protect the land. Ironically, after an old red abandoned house (which was said to be where the creature was summoned from) was torn down and the sightings appeared to have stopped. What ex-actly was the Shenango Valley Werewolf? Did the sightings really stop or did people stop reporting them? A second-hand report was given to author Thomas White in the 2000's of a strange beast with dark fur allegedly en-countered behind a home near Hermitage. The eyewitness still refuses to disclose any information about the sighting. 
If you are in the Shenango Valley area at night and happen to hear a howl or something moving about in the forest, perhaps you too will encounter the Shenango Valley Werewolf. "
Pennsylvania,PA,Mercer County,-80.1875065,41.2619821,,"In the fall of 1991 between 9:30-10:30 pm the eyewitness, after spotlight-ing for deer, came home and went looking for his friends and found them by the old water company. His friends had told him that they had just seen the creature. They shined the spotlight after hearing the noise and saw the creature standing by a telephone pole. Again, the wolf-like creature was standing on two legs. It ran into the woods and they did not see it again. The next day they took a measuring tape and measured from where the creature’s head was just under a spike in the pole and it measured 7 feet from the ground. The Mercer County area has been a hotbed of Dogman sightings since the 1960’s with many of the sightings coming from the Shenango Reservoir. 
This report was reported to C.U.E. in 2011 after a meeting of M.A.P.S(Mysteries & Paranormal Society). The eyewitness went on to describe a series of Dogman reports that he had encountered in the 1990’s."
Pennsylvania,PA,New Castle,-80.347009,41.0036719,,"Date Unknown - A woman and her daughter were out walking their dog in the evening by a cemetery before dark, right before thunderstorm. The daughter got bored and decided to go back to the vehicle and wait for her mom to fin-ish the walk. While in the car she saw a bipedal Werewolf with a snout that was about 5 feet tall, that had grayish fur and dark eyes. The creature came out of the bushes and then walked around the vehicle once and went back into bushes. It made eye contact with the daughter who froze in terror. When the mother returned to the car the daughter was hysterical with fear. The mom believes the daughter and doesn’t think she was lying. They seem to think that it is possible that the approaching thunder/electrical storm was used as an energy source by the creature to manifest in this world/dimension.? This cemetery is on the outskirts of town in a rural area. Lots of woods/creeks, good habitat. Daughter was emphatic that the creature was not a Bigfoot. It had a wolf-like snout. This area of Pennsylvania has a lot of weird phenomenon."

His headlights picked up a large canid looking creature running across the road. When it reached the side of the road it dropped to all fours and crawled under a fence that sur-rounded a power transformer. The eyewitness stated the creature had a snout like a dog and was covered in hair. The eyewitness pulled over and grabbed his flashlight, went around the fenced site and found a dug-out area about two feet deep at the fence."
Pennsylvania,PA,Washington County,-80.1875065,40.1367719,,"November 1987 - I was hunting, during doe season, in the woods. I parked my truck on a side road, in Washington county, but it was right on the border, near Greene county. Anyway; I was in a tree stand, looking for deer and heard a lot of rustling leaves, near me. I then saw this wolf-like thing running on its hind legs. It stopped for a moment, sniffed the air, and then ran off. I sat in that tree stand for hours, till the sun was high in the sky. Then, I cautiously returned to my truck. I gave up hunting after this experience. "
Maine,ME,Oxford County,-70.7840564,44.4906897,,"2001 - I'm a night owl. I always stay up late at night and watch TV. I just happened to look out my window one night and saw what I initially thought was a man, sitting on a roof. I thought it was a man, because at first, he looked almost naked, until I saw the hair or fur on him. He then turned his face and what I saw then was frightening. He had pointed ears, like a dog, and a long snout. They were almost like a German Shepard's ears. I could not understand what I was looking at. I just stared at him for a few minutes. I felt like if I moved, it would see me. It sat there on its butt, with human looking arms and legs, but with hair or fur covering them. I backed away from the window very slowly and went to tell my husband. He didn't want to get up and go look, because he thought I was imagining it. I went back to the window and it was gone. I don't know or understand what I saw that night, but I did tell my husband and kids what I saw. It has haunted me for many years until I was just telling a few of my grandchildren, recently at camp. One of them got on the computer and found some pictures of what they thought I meant. It was so scary! I was looking at the same thing I saw on the roof that night! I could not believe it. As I sit here looking at that picture I did not know it really existed many many years ago."
Maine,ME,Palmyra,-69.9999212,45.5913402,,"The Martin family had downsized their lives. A workplace injury had devastated Eric, and Shelley had left her job to take care of her hus-band. As a result, they were looking for a less-expensive place to live. Shelley had found a beautiful, older farm in Palmyra that was just what they needed. It was surrounded by dense woods. Eric's family had always been hunters, and his ""fairly extensive"" collection of guns was a bone of contention with Shelley. With the help of Eric's son, Sean, Eric built a strongbox to hold the guns under lock and key in the barn. Eric and Shelley had a routine of evening coffee on the sheltered porch, provided it wasn't too cold out. One night, they noticed strange, pulsat-ing lights down past the tree line. At first, Sean thought it was just a poacher with a flashlight, but something didn't seem right. Shelley thought it was unnatural. Eric and Sean headed out into the field to investigate. As they approached the woods, the lights went out. It was so quiet, the snap of a tree branch under foot echoed. Eric sent Sean around with his flashlight off, hoping to catch any potential poacher unaware. Eric felt something far beyond any fear he'd ever felt hunting. All Eric and Sean found was each other, not even a track on the ground to give them a hint of what they'd seen. Chelsea's boyfriend Nathan came for a visit, and they decided to go for a walk in the woods with the dogs. The dogs ran out ahead of them, catching a scent. When Chelsea and Nathan caught up, the dogs were rooting around by a large hole in the ground. Nathan thought the overly round hole had been dug with care. Chelsea had a bad feeling about the whole thing, and urged him to leave. Finally, he agreed. What had the dogs found? It was Memorial Day weekend, and Shelley was making the evening coffee. The dogs didn't want to go outside to their pen. Something wasn't right. Eric noticed that it was particularly quiet on that misty evening. When Eric heard an odd sound in the distance, he knew there was some sort of danger out there. Eric began to usher Shelley into the house. She pro-tested, but when she heard some rustling in the distance, accompa-nied by five sets of eyes looking back at them, she realized the danger. They rushed into the house and locked the door. Eric knew it wasn't a bear, but it was huge, and dangerous. The guns were in the barn, and Eric wasn't sure his family was safe in the house. Eric want-ed to get the guns, but Shelley told him to stay. She went up to Chelsea's room and woke her daughter. Chelsea was half-awake when she looked out the window, but laid back down and went back to sleep. All five of the creatures were still there. One stood on its hind legs and looked right at Shelley. Eric felt an instinct to protect his family. With the creatures in the dis-tance, he thought that he might be able to get the family car backed up close enough to get them out. Even with his disability, Eric went outside. Shelley went through the house, closing the windows. She finally found the two hunting dogs hiding in a shadowed corner. If the dogs were scared? Shelley was concerned. When Eric reached the porch, he realized that he might have the distance to get there. It was going to be the longest twenty feet of his life. He started to slowly walk toward the car. When he finally reached it, grabbing the keys and trying to unlock the door, the mo-tion sensor lights popped on. Eric was frightened, and very vulnera-ble. Suddenly, he was face-to-face with one of the creatures. It tried to reach into the light, but something stopped it. It bolted off into the dark-ness. Eric made for the house as quickly as he could. They decided to call the police, hoping for someone else to drive in while they remain sheltered. The police didn't take them seriously, telling Shel-ley to close the windows and lock the doors. Nobody was coming. They were on their own. Shelley heard them approach. They were on the other side of the outside wall, and if they wanted in, they were going to get in. Her family was being held hostage in their own house by these creatures. They weren't able to get the guns. There weren't any police coming. What were they going to do? Grabbing every sharp implement they could find, Shelley went and woke Chelsea. They needed all hands awake and alert. They all went into the mas-ter bedroom and laid on top of the bed, armed, waiting on daylight to come. When they heard the creatures outside, they were petrified. The only thing between the Martins and the creatures was the bedroom window. When morning came, they could finally breathe a sigh of relief. The crea-tures were gone. Eric called Sean, who came over and helped look for tracks. The tracks they did find were huge, with enormous claws. They showed a creature who could walk on two feet. These creatures had been hunting, stalking. Were they werewolves? To this day, nobody knows. "
Maine,ME,Washington,-69.3676576,44.2735583,,"I have a sighting to report. My old neighbor, who committed suicide shortly after his experience, came to me with his experience. We were both Registered Maine Guides (Hunting, Fishing, Recreation). Guiding in Maine is a serious business. The criteria are strict, and guides are ex-pert woodsmen, with years of outdoors experience. Anyway, he confided in me about this sighting. He was hunting his own property during deer season of 2011. The property is located on the Jefferson / Washington town lines (which are also the Knox / Lincoln county lines) in Maine. The particular property is a Christmas tree farm, and is private proper-ty. My friend was watching a run, where deer regularly traveled, cut-ting through his property. He observed for about a minute a bipedal creature walking, with its upper body well above his Christmas trees. It had a ""wolf's head"", was muscular, and covered in hair, but walking like a man. At the end of the sighting, the creature dropped to all fours and took off down the run. He was shaking when he told me the story, and based upon my few years working in law enforcement, I don't be-lieve he was lying. Both of us guided for bear hunters at the time, and I know he was very familiar with bears, and Maine wildlife in general. He made a particular emphasis on the ""pointed ears"". He said it ""looked like a werewolf"". In Maine, people do see these things, and generally call them Wendigo. After that sighting, I carried a firearm going to my barn at night. I am certain that he told me the truth. Unfortunately, he for some reason committed suicide shortly after he told me about the sighting, which was very fresh at the time. The area has some large tracts of woods, with very limited access, due to private property. There is a stream passing through the area, and some high ridges. Also, old cellar holes and stone walls are scattered throughout the forest behind the property. Food sources are plentiful in the area, with old apple trees, berry patches, deer, turkey, snowshoe hares. Bears are present in the area, but not in huge numbers. Moose are also present, but again not in huge numbers. While I still own a house very near the spot, I have moved to South Dakota, and have no intention of moving back to Maine, due to political-economic reasons. I am curious if other Maine folks have seen these things. It seems to me that people have, but always in hushed conversations about ""an uncle""."

2017 - Not sure what it is. My girlfriend and I were hiking around western MD and I started getting a eerie feeling and I seen something following \stalking us but it wasn't as big as what I've heard these dogmen to be. Also there's a little equipment yard were I sometimes work on vehicles and behind the yard is a corn field and it had been cut down and in the middle of this field is a island of trees. While I was working one afternoon I heard what sounded like 50wolves howling at once I turned around and seen something crouching down very low to the ground coming out of the island of trees. Looked alot like the thing that had been following my girlfriend and I but that was at least 20miles away.also there's a area nearby where my father told me that he and his friends would see this wolfman thing running next to their vehicle in the 1960s and supposedly had killed alot of livestock in the area. I came across this article of something called the snarly yow. It was on the same mountain my father has all these werewolf stories about. I will try to upload the article for you. The area is around Hagerstown MD."
Maryland,MD,Montgomery County,-77.2405153,39.1547426,,"One morning, around 6 AM, about two years ago, I was living not far from Washington D.C. A friend of a friend needed a roommate to afford the rent for an apartment he had found. So, when I was told about this, my first thought was, “Oh yeah! Here’s my chance to move out of my parent’s house!” After about six months of living in the area, I noticed that on certain nights, I would hear loud roars in the distance. I could never tell how far away the noise was coming from. It would sometimes sound nearby or just far enough away where I wouldn’t mind being outside to see what it might be making the sound, from a safe distance.

I lived in a quiet, wooded area. A lot of people lived in the area. I actually lived within five minutes walking distance away from the University of Maryland. One morning, around 6 AM, I just snapped awake from a deep, sound sleep, for no reason at all. I started to go back to sleep but thought to myself, “Why am I wide awake and alert?” It was strange. I was completely awake. Then, right in my backyard, I heard a low, deep growl. That’s when I knew something was up. The moment I heard that, I knew. That was why I woke up. I remained quiet and didn’t move for the next five to ten minutes, as this thing started to become very active in my backyard. It went from the low growls to heavy breathing. This thing’s lungs had to be massive because it sounded the same exact way a horse would if you were standing right next to it. When it breathed through its nose, it sounded more like a horse, but this thing sounded like it was aggressive. I knew it wasn’t a horse in the backyard. That wouldn’t be possible but what I saw was very real. It literally ran from my backyard into the dividing fence of my backyard, from my neighbor’s backyard, again and again. It made no sense for it to be doing that. It would often stop and sniff around and sneeze very loudly. It sounded like it was right next to my window and I was on the second floor. I didn’t want to look out the window because I thought that there’s no way in the world no one else is hearing this right now but me. I thought, “This thing is trying to get my attention on purpose!” I stayed still in bed, without moving and I was beyond scared! I really thought it was a werewolf, even before I saw it. I always thought that they were real. The guys that lived below me started yelling and screaming, “El diablo!” Over and over again, they yelled that. I could hear the thing leaving the backyard, so I hurried to try and get a look at it. When I did, all I saw was its back side. This thing was massive, with broad shoulders, like a bodybuilder and it had ears sticking up on its head. It slowly walked away, until I lost sight of it."
Massachusetts,MA,Hampden County,-72.6624209,42.1172314,,"2013 - I'm reporting a possible Dogman sighting, based on the info provided by my son and his friend. This occurred in Montgomery, Ma. As a four-wheel enthusiast, my oldest son has become familiar with off-roading trails and rural routes that he and his friends use regularly; often at night. On this occasion, they were in his Ford Explorer, following a familiar route, in a rural town, through a remote, wooded area. Being winter, the plows stopped at a certain point, leaving a bank of snow at that point, marking where the town abandoned maintenance of that unpaved road for the winter, leaving further use of this road to those who dare. As my son related, he four-wheeled through the snow bank and drove along the road, which winded over a mountain. He concentrated on his driving, focusing on the road, as his close friend sat in the front passenger seat. Suddenly, his friend exclaimed, ""Look! Look! What's that? What IS that?"" My son didn't lift up his eyes, to see it, because he wanted to stay on the road. His buddy pointed to where it went. So, my son quickly swung his truck around and illuminated the area with his off-road lights and headlights. His friend described what he saw as running like a wolf, but not a wolf. He said it was big like a bear, but not a bear. He also said it had long hair and was lighter in color than a brown bear. He said it was grey, in color. They sat there, for a minute or so, staring into the darkness. Suddenly, something (another one?) pushed the SUV from behind, making it slide along the muddy snowy road, a short distance. They both whipped their heads around, only to see the blackness of night, out the rear window. Then, he quickly started the truck and sped out of there, not seeing the creature(s) again. My son stated that it could not have been the same creature his buddy spotted, because once he had illuminated the area, with the truck's lights, they would have spotted movement against the white, snow background. Another of my son's friends insisted this was a Bigfoot, as he had an encounter years ago, but this description seems to better fit a Dogman. This experience, whatever it was, is absolutely true."
Massachusetts,MA,Hampden County,-72.6624209,42.1172314,6/8/2015,"Since it was summer break for my school, I was lazily lounging at home watching TV. I got bored, so I went outside to see if I could do anything with my chickens, like feed them worms and snails. Before I go into more detail, I should explain the area I live in. My home is on the outskirts of the city I live in. I had about 5 or 7 chickens at the time, and we hadn’t expanded the coop, so it was a small pen connecting to two sides of the chicken coop, which is wooden and sturdy; the only ways to get into the coop is either through the trap door attached to the big door and the three windows; one window is on one side of the door and the second window on the other side. The third window is a large window. Keep in mind that they all have traps connected to them so they can be closed. We have 7 acres of woodland that we call the “back pasture,” and if you’ve ever been back there you could see that it’s a popular habitat for the local deer; there was also a wild boar that was roaming around at the time, and I don’t know how it got there. We had been having trouble with poachers for a while, considering the population of deer in the woods. One poacher had set up a trail cam, one that was motion-activated. There was an old rusty deer stand that had been put on a tree a long time ago, and the tree had begun to grow around it. Beyond our acres of woods, there’s a large cornfield owned by our neighbors, and beyond that is a forest. I don’t know what the forest is like beyond the field since we’ve never been there. I went outside to do something with my chickens, and I had brought along a bucket of corn for feeding the deer after. When I walked out of my home, I saw a doe was sitting in the tall grass; I thought it was sleeping since it had its head down and wasn’t moving. I, being the curious little nut I was, decided that I would sneak up on the deer and get a picture of it to show to my mother when she got home from work. I crept as silently as I could across the yard that separated me from the deer. I should also mention that we have a clearing with a burn pit in it that was filled with cedar branches. I was creeping across my yard towards the deer, and when I had cleared the burn pit and was about ten yards from it I realized that the deer wasn’t asleep, but it was dead. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen; its intestines were completely gone, the flesh on the body of the doe shredded to pieces and blood absolutely everywhere. It looked as if it had been sitting there for a while, and it smelled like it, too; most of the blood was dried and the air reeked with the stench of rotting flesh, urine, and what seemed like a hint of wet dog. Something that creeped me out about the scene was although it was a rotting carcass, there were no insects at all around it; it was as if the usual lively forest was deader than the deer. Not even the neighbor’s cattle made a sound. It looked as if the poor deer had simply been left after being brutally attacked and half-eaten, which it most likely was. I left the bucket at the beginning of the trail, thinking that I would come out later with my mother and grain the deer when she got home. Then, I started to walk back to my house. I had barely taken a few steps when I heard a low, snarling growl that sounded like a wolf, although it seemed distorted as if it were being played on an old radio(sorry, that’s the only way I think of describing it). Against my better judgment, I turned my head around, and I saw what looked like the biggest freaking wolf I’d ever seen. It was on all fours, its fur was black and matted in places; its face was what you’d expect a wolf to look like, although it was broad and the muzzle seemed a little short, although the way it was curling its lips made it look as if its snout was plenty long, and its eyes were yellow; not a bright yellow like the yellow of a flower or the sun, but a dim, amber, red yellow, if that makes sense. Its ears looked like that of a Doberman pincer, with the cropped effect. Its front legs were long, and it looked as if it were a body builder. Its “paws,” if you can even call them paws, looked like huge hands with long claws at the end of them. It stood up, and I heard the most sickening popping sound you could ever imagine. It sounded like the sound of popping joints, but it seemed amplified as if it were being played through a microphone and the sound was coming out of loud speakers. Its body looked like a body builder’s pumped up on steroids, it was so big. It had no tail, that I could tell, and it seemed to tower over me, although I was a good 10 meters from it. I was about five foot four inches at the time, and I came nowhere close to its height; it was so tall that the tip of its ears could almost touch the top of a young cedar. It let out a loud howl, which sounded more like a roar and it charged at me. Doing the only thing I knew to do while hyped up on fear and adrenaline, I began to run away from it. I remember clearing my yard in what seemed like hours but was most likely only a few seconds, and running inside, slamming and locking all of the doors and windows. As I calmed down a small bit, I had realized that if it had really wanted to kill me that it would have; that what I had experienced was not an attack charge, but a bluff. I was lucky to get away with my life.
Although this happened almost two years ago, it still terrifies me to think about it. The deer was gone the next day, and ever since that evening I have been weary around the woods, only going in them in broad daylight, only when I absolutely had to, and never without a weapon. Sadly, I cannot say that I am one of those people that have stopped experiencing things after the encounter, although I only had nightmares for a month after that day in June. Nothing really started to happen again until about 2 months ago when I was staying up at night playing on the laptop. I had started to hear things moving around on the porch and turned on the light to see the shape of something huge disappearing behind the corner of my house. There was also one of the rare times I went into the woods after the first encounter when I was helping my mother clear brush from the hunting clearing. I was going to get the mower, and was walking the trail to do so when I heard bipedal footsteps following me off to my side; they stopped whenever I stopped, and I eventually ran out of the woods and I haven’t been back since.
I asked my late great grandmother about the creature I had seen in the woods, and she informed me that there was something called the wolf-head man that stalked the Kansa tribe, preying on small children that strayed too far from their tepees. Later, I was informed by my history teacher that my house had actually been built on a tribal burial ground, and I have since been wondering if that had something to do with it. I hadn’t heard about the wolf-head man before she had told me about it; when I saw that there were several eye-witness reports that were proved to be truthful, it made me feel a lot better about coming out with this information. I had attempted to tell people previous to this submission, but everyone either said I was stupid, crazy, or just a plain liar. One thing’s for certain; I am not stupid, I am not crazy, and I am most definitely not a liar. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a Dogman.

New Hampshire,NH,Hillsborough County,-71.6673352,42.8334794,6/1/2017,"6/1/2017 - I was going through the hiking trails with my dog, behind my town’s
local high school, fairly late one night. I had gone there plenty of
times before since I was young, so I wasn’t frightened. While I was walking my dog, he kept trying to stop and was whimpering, which was strange, because he is normally a very brave dog. After walking for about 10 minutes longer, I heard huge branches crashing and breaking. That’s when I started to become frightened and decided to turn back. While walking back, I could tell that something was following me. I was terrified! Suddenly, after a minute of calmness, this creature leaped in front of me, across the trail. The creature had long, dark fur and was enormous! It wasn’t a bear. It was like a very muscular, huge wolf. After seeing this, I picked up my dog and sprinted off the trail, without seeing it again. That was easily one of the most terrifying nights of my life!"

As he got closer the figure stood in front of the car blocking the roadway. Irwin had to stop his car in order to avoid hitting the creature. The creature was described as being over six-foot tall and covered with black fur that looked wet and matted, it appeared not to have any forelegs but had a pair of huge powerful hind legs. The creature glanced through the wind-shield of the car revealing two piercing red eyes; it stood a few minutes then . turned and continued across the road, walking upright like a hu-man in a peculiar robot-like fashion."
New York,NY,Broome County,-75.8533954,42.1791865,4/22/2016,"4/22/2016 - My husband listens to your podcast regularly and until a couple days ago, I thought he was nuts. While my encounter was not as up-close and personal as many of your guests, it was none the less terrifying to me and I feel that it has forever changed me and the way I view the world. I had just arrived home, a few minutes after dusk, after visiting my parents. Our location is rural, but we do have a few neighbors within shouting distance of us. We have 33 acres of mixed forests and fields, with lots of thick brush, consisting mostly of briars. I had my 2 young children with me, in the Jeep (ages 2 yrs and 11 mo), when I pulled in the driveway that night. My husband was working late, with an emergency case. It was near fully dark when I arrived home. As soon as I stepped from my vehicle, I felt creeped out. It felt different outside. We have lots of peepers and crickets that would normally be making lots of noise. Even the birds are usually chirping until an hour or more past dark. This time, there was not a sound. It was very warm that evening, so the peepers should have been in full chorus. Because of my uneasy feeling, I was rushing to get the kids in the house, at the same time, and did not want to leave RJ in the car alone, for a minute, as I routinely do. He and our older daughter, who was asleep, are normally too heavy for me to carry together, at the same time. That night though, I grabbed them both, 1 in each arm, after finding my keys to the front door and carried them both. Usually, I would use the auto garage door, however, the opener did not work. When I reached the front door, at the top of the stairs and got situated, on the front porch, I put down Angelina, in order to open the front door. As soon as I turned my attention back to the front door, it happened. Somewhere to my left came a sound that will be forever seared into my memory. It started low and slowly increased to a moderately loud growl. It was deep-toned and very guttural and was angry/hateful in character. It was nothing like anything I had ever heard before, but it did sound canine in origin, especially after spending an hour listening to various animal growls. The growl continued for approximately 10 seconds. I was so terrified, I was fumbling with the keys. It really felt like I was dropped into an 80's horror film. I really did think I was going to die. I was sure any second, the thing making this sound was going to pounce upon me and the kids and eat us, right on the spot. The growl sounded as though the creature was standing just off to my left. I refused to look out of fear of what I would see. It sounded so close and at or even above eye level with me. My porch extends another 5 feet to the left and then off the porch is the front of the house. There’s 35 yards of grass to the edge of the tree line and there’s a field with 2 foot tall grass opposite that. There’s also a small shed between our porch and the tree line. Standing on the front porch, from my head to the ground is approximately 9 feet. So, I assume it was standing near the corner of the house. I had never been so afraid, until a few moments later, when it actually spoke to me. As the growl continued, it seemed to melt into audible words, spoken in a very deep and gruff tone, that seemed to have a rough sort of reverberation quality to them. What I heard as clear as day was, ""You can't get in."" The only word that I’m unsure of is the first, “You.” As the sound of growl transitioned to English words and it sounded more like Yyyyhhh. Now, I was histerical and dropping the keys. Finally, I got the right one in and got the door open and got in. I had to kick my daughter through the door, regretfully. Strangely, she seemed oblivious to what had just transpired, as if she didn't hear it. I slammed the door shut and never looked. I didn’t hear anything else that night. I called my husband and his friend, to let them know what happened. So, I never did actually see what terrorized me, because I couldn’t look. I’ve had 2 days to to think about this encounter and talk with my husband, who has listened to every episode of Dogman Encounters Radio. I’m fairly certain that this was what was growling at me. The sound was not human and seemed like it was amped or miked up, because it seemed so powerful. Not that it was a loud growl, but it seemed unnatural. Also, the height it seemed to emanate from and the silence that preceded it lead me to that conclusion. My husband agrees, because the entire week, he too has been on edge. We have lived here for a year and all seemed normal, until this week. Our cat, which is an indoor cat, got out accidentally and has vanished, without a trace. She has gotten out before and just stood around, until we got her back in the house. Also, my husband said Tuesday night, he experienced the silence outside and it really unnerved him too. He says he has never experienced anything so eerie. On Wednesday, he took our dog up into the woods, to look for our cat and felt very uneasy. He said the dog kept tucking its tail and turning around, wanting to go home. It’s not like our dog or my husband to feel uneasy in the woods, because both of them love the outdoors and are very comfortable in nature. On Thursday, at dusk, he took the dog around the back lot and says something took off from the thickets, at a sprint and came crashing through the woods, down the hill, towards him. He always carries a sidearm when he is out and is normally not afraid of anything, but he actually turned and ran back up towards the house. Whatever was charging stopped seconds after he stopped to listen and did not make another sound. He was very concerned when he came in, stating that he knows what big game sounds like and that this was, ""Just not right"". Even he was surprised that he ran from the sound. The following day was when my encounter happened. After talking about all of these events with my husband, we are concerned that there is a Dogman in the area. My husband listened to Episodes 90 and 91 and is so worried that this thing has decided to stalk 1 or both of our kids. My husband said that based on those episodes, it sounds like the Dogman plans ahead when snatching kids and he thinks it may have been scouting the area, with plans to do just that. He said it was doing that or that it was waiting for me to leave 1 of the kids in the jeep, for a minute. Either way, none of this is good. The main reason why I wanted to submit this was because it seems very unique in that it spoke to me. It wasn’t the words, but the feeling it gave me that disturbed me most. It was as if it was trying to give me the impression that I was nothing and that I was weak and just food. I got the impression that it was saying “Can't get in,” like “Ha ha! You’re mine!” It's hard to explain, because it seemed like It was conveying its frame of mind and that it was, for lack of a better description, making fun of me, in a very cruel way. I really want to know if you have ever heard of 1 of these monsters actually speaking. My husband and I really want to believe that our conclusions are wrong, but instinct and your show have us highly convinced that it in fact was a Dogman. We thank you deeply, for keeping the show going, being informed, and not leading us to believe that the monster is probably literally hiding out and waiting for us. That just might save 1 or all of our lives. Thank you for all that you do. Please let us know what you think about all of this."
New York,NY,Tioga County,-76.3637285,42.1256317,,"October 2000 - It was later in the evening, when i was driving back to my in-laws house, by myself and was going down a dirt road. I saw something in the ditch up ahead and on the right and didn't really know what it was, until I got up far enough so that my head lights could catch it. I didn't know anything about Dogmen, until a couple of years ago. This thing had an outline of a huge dog, but when I got closer, it turned and looked at me. I just floored it. It didn't really bother me, until I noticed it looking at me and I saw that it was actually grasping what it was eating. I got back and didn't say exactly what I saw. I just asked them if there were any big dogs or wolves up where they lived. My father in-law just laughed and said, ""No."" Then he asked why. I didn't say anything. The thing I will NEVER forget are the reddish, orange eyes, that just kept staring at me!"
New York,NY,Lake Champlain,-73.3800905,44.586581,,Date Unknown - Two men driving near Lake Champlain sighted “two huge wolves running on their back two feet” along an interstate highway. One witness claimed the creatures were “running nearly 100 miles per hour.”
Arizona,AZ,Navajo County,-110.1402594,35.4019765,7/2/2015,"7/2/2015 - While scanning the valley floor, for sheep, a mile from my house, I noticed two loping figures. Initially, I thought the figures were coyotes or stray dogs, but as the 2 figures neared an old sunken vehicle, I realized that the things were about the size of the vehicle. Nearly 8 feet long! No animal could be that big on the rez. I watched the 2 figures until they disappeared into the woods, across the valley. It was starting to get dark, but the moon was bright enough, so I walked without a light. As I walked down the mountain, I heard something yelling. It was like a howl or a yell. I started to hurry. Then, when I got to my house, I locked the door and spent the night listening to the strangest sounds. I'm sure it was a skinwalker, but I found this site and was surprised."
Arizona,AZ,Cochise County,-109.949686,31.828458,,"Auguswas 17 years old, at the time. My Dad and mom had taken my little brother and sister to Tucson, to do something for the day. We lived in a trailer, in a rural area, outside of Sierra Vista. We had 2 horses, 2 dogs, a cow, and chickens, on the small amount of land we had. As the oldest son, it was my job to feed and take care of them. On the night in question, it was a stormy monsoon rain, with thunder and lightning going on. But, like monsoon's can be, they rage and then settle into a lull and rage again. I was getting ready to settle down and watch a good movie, when all of a sudden, my 2 dogs started barking and wouldn't shut-up, when i told them to calm down. In the previous week or so, before that, my dogs had been acting up and barking a lot, at night. I attributed this to coyotes that i'd heard howling, in the night. So, i got my dad's 30-30 and just 1 bullet. In case i had to shoot, to scare off the coyote or kill it, if rabid. I rested the loaded rifle near the wall, by the back door and turned on the flood lights, outside the trailer. The rain had just stopped, so I looked out by the window, near the front door and saw our 2 horses and cow staring, as if through the front door, to the back door of the trailer, where the dogs where barking. I thought, ""Maybe they're scared of the coyotes,"" so i grabbed the rifle and opened up the back door. As i was getting near the back door, i heard my dogs whimpering and crying. Now i was thinking, ""Is it be a pack of coyotes?"" So, i put a few bullets in my pocket, figuring i could load them if i didn't like what i saw. I opened the door and the darndest thing happened! My 2 dogs B-LINE rush past me, to the center of the trailer and hunker down, in the kitchen. Mud is everywhere on the floor, from their paws and i'm pissed, because i have to clean it up. So, i close the door and go try to get my dogs to get out, but they wouldn't budge and squirmed out of my arms, when i tried to grab them. They were terrified. Now, i was mad at the ""coyotes"" and grabbed the rifle, to go run them off or kill them. The trailer sits on a foundation of blocks. The front and back doors are accessible by a set of small stairs. I'm 5'6"" by the way. I opened the back door and was looking out in the darkness, at that point. I was about to step out, when I saw a set of eyes looking back at me, out of the darkness. From the top of my head, in the trailer, to the ground, is around 7 plus feet or so. And, here is a set of eyes, looking at me, level and square on. i'm like...darn coyote must be on the small gravel hill we used to pave the road or it's a bird on a mesquite bush. But, i was thinking to myself, that monsoon was awfully bad and rained hard. What kind of bird would hunker down on a mesquite bush and why would a coyote be out in a downpour? So, i'm raising my rifle and drawing a bead on the eyes, when lightning lights up the night. All of a sudden, the lightning illuminates the small gravel hill, that's like 6 feet high and the surrounding mesquite bushes. The light winks out as fast as it appeared, from the lightning though. There was nothing on the gravel hill and no bird on any of the mesquite bushes. Then, it dawned on me. Whatever it was, it was very tall and was still staring at me. A sense of dread crept over me all of a sudden, as I realized that the 30-30 only had 1 measley bullet and if i missed, there was no way i'd be able to reload, before it was on me. I kept the gun pointed at it, as i quickly closed the door. I locked the door, realizing this trailer would never withstand whatever it was out there, if it attacked. I locked the front door and turned on all of the lights, in the house. I grabbed all the bullets, the 30-06, and 22 rifle and then got in the kitchen, with the dogs and i loaded each rifle, full-on. I hugged my dogs and prayed that whatever it was went away and didn't attack. I stayed awake that whole night until my parents got back. My dad was furious that all the lights were on. My dad checked outside, for ""coyotes"", but whatever it was, was gone."
Arkansas,AR,Benton County,-94.479976,36.2661518,,"In October 1972, my husband, our 2 babies, my brother, and I left Leavenworh, KS in our 1968 VW van, on a camping trip to a recreational area in Arkansas called ""Beaver Lake."" When we finally got there, we found a fairly remote campsite at the far end of the park. We wanted to be alone as the babies woke often during the night and needed to feed. We didn't want to disturb any other campers. Shortly, after pulling into our campsite, my brother pitched his tent next to the van. The rest of us were going to sleep in the van. The campsite was in an area with a horseshoe-shaped, rocky, terraced ledge, that rose from around 50 feet to around 100 feet as it curved around, behind the 4 campsites. Because of mature trees and thick brush, daylight had trouble poking into our spot. Fast forward to that night. Some time around 3:30AM, I heard some animal sounds on the ridge that I though were being made by coyotes. The babies were asleep and all was quiet otherwise. I peered out the window, but couldn't see what was making the sounds, because it was so dark. Still hearing odd yips and howls, I laid back down on the back seat. Moments later, there was a huge, crashing, ""BANG"" on the van wall, right next to my head. My husband leapt up, out of a full sleep. My brother bolted out of his tent and jumped into the van with us. We were all in a panic, looking in every direction, trying to see what had hit the van like that. My brother finally yelled that he saw something moving behind the van. We all turned, just in time to see a large shadow moving about 20 feet behind the van, from left, to right. After about 20 minutes had passed without any of us seeing movement out there, my husband and brother went out to inspect the van for damage, but found none. We then started hearing pounding steps, coming from the brush, about 50 feet behind us. The guys eased back into the front seat of the van. That's when my husband turned on the headlights and stepped on the brake pedal for rear light. Instantly, there was a huge commotion. He started the engine and that's when, in the glow from the headlights, we could see a hairy THING, 10 feet away and coming toward the van! As it got closer, its silver-tipped hairs glistened in the light. It had a greyish streak from its shoulders down its back, to its buttocks. The creature was walking on 2 legs, was around 7 or 8 feet tall, had a barrel-chest, and skinny legs. It never gave us a good view of its eyes, so I can't tell you what they looked like. I COULD see that the face was not ape-like. It was dog-like. Its ears had tufts of fur on top of them and it was very human-like in its movements and general body structure. It moved smoothly and quickly, around to the back of the van where it followed the base of the ridge, away from us. That's when it let out a menacing ""Huff"" and a low, rumbling growl, like a dog. Insanely, my husband and brother bolted from the van, trying to get a better look. That's when a shower of gravel came at us. My husband and brother tore back into the van and burned up the road getting us out of there! I kept looking out the back window and they looked in the rearview mirrors, but none of us ever saw it again. It just didn't seem like a Sasquatch was what we had seen. It seemed too dog-like in its face and was too slim in its body. I still have P.T.S.D. like feelings to this day, due to that encounter! "

Then dead Quiet. I thought it was the 2 guys messing around but I didn't hear any laughter after it . The hair on my arms stood up wondering what it was. It sounded very much like the sounds on your website only with screams in it . I turned around immediately to leave Because it was getting late around 1840 And the Sun was starting to set .About 20' back down the trail I noticed a black Figure standing about 120' from Where the 2 young guys were standing earlier. At first I thought it was a bear Standing up because it was about 7' tall and backlit by the sun. The face was partially obscured by a branch and it was too far away to smell.I took 2 quick pictures of it and left .I didn't realize what I had photographed until later on when I reviewed the pictures .  "
California,CA,Sacramento County,-121.3541631,38.47467,,"1953 - The encounter I'd like to share is not my own, but that of my mother. She used to tell me stories when I was young, about strange things she had experienced, in her life. I remembered this Dogman type of encounter, while listening to your show, on YouTube. There's not particularly a lot of detail to this encounter, but what you may find interesting is the location. The sighting took place in Sacramento, Califonia, around 1953, not too far from our state's capital. Using Google maps to get an approximate location and lay of the land, I can see the sighting area was about 1000ft to the west of and perpendicular to the American river. Across the river from the east bank, it's only about another 2000ft east to the state capitol. So, this took place fairly close to a heavily populated area. My mother states, when she was about 12 years old, she was laying on the couch, watching television. That's when she noticed a scary dog face, looking at her, through a low pane window. The window was either on or by the door. I'm unclear on this fact. In any event, the head, she said, must have been about 2 to 2 1/2 feet above the ground. She covered her face in fright, with her pillow. After a minute or so, she snuck a peek, figuring she must be imaging things. She saw it was gone and felt a little better. Then, she noticed it was now looking through another higher window. Its head was now about 4 to 4 1/2 feet above the ground. According to her recollection, there was nothing outside that window for a dog to stand on. At that point, she just ran to another room, in terror. She doesn't really recall what happened after that. She describes the animal as being dark grey, with glowing red eyes. Seemingly panting or baring its teeth. She didn't see the body, but had the impression that it was thin. Unfortunately, she doesn't recall the time of day, month, or season. My parents tell me there's likely some American Indian burial grounds in the area, as there had been excavations near the river, which yielded Native American arrow heads and other artifacts. I know it's been mentioned in some of the encounters you've presented, a proximity to rivers and Native American burial grounds. I even asked my mother if there were corn fields around the area, since that to has been mentioned in the encounters. She said only the small patch of corn stalks in their own backyard. I don't think that qualifies. The area around my grandparent's house was not really wooded. The neighborhood was mostly large fields with a few horses and some cattle. The areas around the river is wooded now though and was probably a lot more so in 1953, than it is today. Another pararnormal story about this area is that on Monster Quest's episode detailing the Mothman, someone supposedly was taking dusk or night shot pictures of the Tower Bridge in 2009 and saw a flying huminoid shape or something fly off of the bridge. The Tower Bridge is in the 1000 foot range from my grandparents house. Spooky! Thats all there is really."
California,CA,San Mateo County,-122.4014193,37.4337342,,"On August 27th, 2016, my 10-year-old grandson was sitting in a car, at a restaurant parking lot, waiting for his paternal grandmother. Across the street from him, on a sidewalk, he noticed a large creature, which I determined to be 7 to 8 feet tall, from talking with him. It was walking on 2 legs towards a wooded area at the end of a sidewalk and disappeared into some brush. The creature did not appear concerned about my grandson, as it was in no hurry. When I asked him about what he had seen, he described a classic K9-Type Dogman, with red eyes. His distance from creature was approximately 30 feet.
Daly City is semi-rural, with many pockets of woodlands and some tracts of forest. The area where he saw the creature has paved roads and sidewalks, ringed with areas of trees."
Colorado,CO,Prowers County,-102.2547919,37.8433756,2/9/2017,"2/9/2017 - Well, I am 24 years old, male and live in the middle of nowhere. Literally. I will be short and simple about my encounter. I was getting home late one day, after dropping my sister off at the airport in Lamar, Colorado. I live just under 7 miles north of the Oklahoma border, on 250 acres of land. I have a trap line running around my property for coyotes. The first 2 traps I checked were empty, so I headed south. That’s when I saw this thing. At first, I thought it was a coyote. A BIG coyote! It was almost 5 feet tall, on all fours! It was caught in my trap and was running around, making a dust cloud, and then it stopped and looked at me. Now, I use a Duke No. 3 leg-hold trap, so I can catch a variety of things in it. Anyways, I slammed on the brakes and my truck stalled, because it’s a manual. I was fumbling for the keys to start it. It’s an old farm truck, with a carburetor on it and it had quite an after-fire. Once it heard that, it lunged at me and roared. I saw that it had its hand (not paw but a hand) caught in my trap (right hand to be exact). It had probably been looking for the dead rabbit I had in the bait hole next to the trap. It then stood up and ripped the 2 earth anchors I had, 24 inches in the ground, right out! It took me a long time to put them in with a 10-pound hammer, but it pulled them straight out, within 15 seconds. After it did that, it just stood there, looking at me. It felt like an eternity and I knew my .357 would do nothing to stop this thing if it came at me. I prayed to God that it wouldn’t come for me, in my truck. I was looking at it in shock and awe and noticed that it had orange eyes. They weren’t glowing. Instead, they had a tint, like a cats eyes in the dark. They may have been reflecting my headlights. I can’t be sure. It then took a step towards me, curled up its upper lip, showing me its teeth. They were huge! The longest 2 had to have been 4-5 inches long! It then growled at me and then it was gone in the blink of an eye. I was scared crapless then! I jammed the truck into gear and spun the tires, getting out of dodge! Like I said earlier, it seemed like an eternity, but it must have lasted no more than 30 seconds at the max.

I later returned with an Indian friend of mine. He is part Arapaho. I grew up with him and trusted him. He told me some stories that were passed down through his grandparent’s tribe and mentioned something about a Loup Garou or french werewolf. He also told me how fur trappers, in the late 1700’s-1800’s, were chased off the land in the Rockies from this thing. After some research online, I found your channel and here I am now. I really am glad you have made this channel for people who have encountered these things. I use to work ’till about 10-11 at night, but I sleep with the lights on now. It sounds silly for a 24-year-old to be doing that, but to be honest to God, I’m still frightened by this thing. I haven’t bothered going out looking for my lost trap because I’ll bet the thing has torn it apart by now."
Idaho,ID,Ada County,-116.2420304,43.478767,,"February 2008 - I saw a Dogman walking along the greenbelt in Boise, Idaho. And to be more specific, the area would be Garden City. The actual location on the greenbelt would be the area of the greenbelt that is just on the other side of Veteran’s Parkway Bridge. (for those not familiar with the area, the Boise River flows through downtown Boise and Garden City. The greenbelt is a walking/biking pathway that is paved that goes right next to the river.) It was 3:15 am (in February 2008) and I was scraping the ice off of my car window. I had to be to work at 4 am. I realized that it was eerily quiet, I looked up, and I saw it walking along the greenbelt going towards the Veteran’s Parkway Bridge. (The bridge goes over the Boise River, and the greenbelt pathway goes under the bridge.) It was tall, I would guess over 7 feet. It turned it’s head and looked at me, it had green neon colored glowing eyes. I said out loud “Oh, my God.” It turned it’s head back and continued walking along the greenbelt. It was walking slowly, I was frozen with fear and didn’t move until I saw it vanish behind the building that is next to the Veteran’s Parkway Bridge. (I assume that it continued along the greenbelt under the bridge.) It had dark brown fur all over its body. Pointed ears, long snout, weird legs, a tail. I got a pretty good look at it. That section of the greenbelt is at the end of a dead-end street and has a couple of business there with parking lots that are all lit up with street lights. I only saw it that one time."

North Idaho, HooDoo Valley 
Dogman Sighting details::
Last winter, right after the first snow, my mother and I were driving home from Coeur D' Alene. You have to cross the train tracks twice to get to my house. After the second crossing is our neighbors that hang all kinds of crazy signs about Giants in the woods, Government cover ups, and the HooDoo legend of the Howler. We've always thought these people were talking about Sasquatch. We are members of the BFRO, but we never guessed a chance for Dogman. We were passing the loonie house and it was around 22:00 with clear vision. There's a bullpine treeline to my right and a hillside to the left, and my property straight on top of the hill. My brights were on and I remember scanning the treeline as we were passing, and about 12ft up were TWO RED REFLECTED EYES, SURROUNDED BY A BLACK MASS WITH SHOULDERS, NO NECK, AND PRONOUNCED EARS. My shock caused me to ditch the from not paying attention to the road. We were high centered for about 5 minutes, I stepped out to lock my hubs, and I remember that OVERWHELMING FEELING OF BEING WATCHED, which hurried my project. When I got back in the car, the feeling didn't go away. I quickly got out of the ditch and sped up the hill to the house. My Mom was asking me why I was so worried, which she later found out why. About midnight, Mom was woken up by THE MOST GUTTERAL HOWLING YOU CAN IMAGINE. Mom yelled at me threw the house if I was awake, and I had already had my window cracked and listening to the sounds that we STILL HEAR every now and then. I then later looked for anyone who knew anything about what I saw. I then located Mr. Vic who runs ""Dogman Encounters"" on the east coast. He gave me the best info he could, which was extremely helpful. I then ARMED MYSELF WITH AN AR15, .45 REVOLVER, AND A .380. It was the best I had at the time. I figured a guy on the phone might be full of it, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE TRUTH IS TO FIND IT YOURSELF. I tracked threw the snow to the location I seen the eyes and the exact tree. There were NO TRACKS IN THE SNOW! I thought I was just seeing things and got all worked up over nothing, but then I looked up. around 13-15 feet up the tree, and about 7 feet up as well were CLAW MARKS DUG INTO THE TREE. I started looking for other trees and sure enough, THERE WAS A TRAIL OF CLAW MARKS FROM TREE TO TREE. Eventually the mistery trail came to an end and gave into another shocking trail. Large enough to dwarf a lion print were THE LARGEST DOG PRINTS I'VE EVER SEEN! The Trail seemed to step over large brush piles and bushes, eventually it lead to the quad trail that follows the lower part of my property and HooDoo Lake. What I saw next still lies there. A DEER CARCASS WITH NO HEAD, NO HIND QUARTERS, AND NO VITAL ORGANS. On closer examination, the neck bone was crumbled and shattered surrounded by torn flesh. Both legs were broken with no bite marks, and the ribs had been separated in a pattern that indicated hyperextention. There was a lot of scuffle in the snow from cyotes, but I've never seen cyotes leave the breast meat and back straps? What concerned me even more was, I found a leg wedged in the fork of a thin pine about 12 ft off the ground. THIS TREE COULDN'T SUPPORT A BOBCAT. I've never gone back in the woods behind my house without being armed since. My neighbors now think I'm the crazy one. I dress in full combat gear when I set trail cams. I guess I am the weird one now, but I will tell you this, there is something in my woods that has the rancher across the street thinking a Grizzly attacked his cows in November. Every neighbor hears the howls. I asked my land lord at the bar if he had seen or herd anything while he was living here, and his face went white as a ghost. I haven't had a sighting since, but I did have an ice ball thrown at my car, and there's no kids in this neighborhood.

Idaho,ID,Idaho Falls,-112.0339645,43.4916514,,"My name is Angela. I am a 47 year old female from Idaho Falls, Idaho. I grew up in Idaho and I am an avid animal lover. Especially Wolves since I was very young.
I am writing to tell you about my Dogman encounter when I was around 16 or 17 years old. It would have been around 1986 or 1987.
Anyway, myself, my friend L. (Female) and my other friend B. (Male) decided one night to go into our local cemetery and look for what is called ""the knocking grave"" and the ""Werewolf grave"". We found the knocking grave and discovered that it is just a loose board which vibrates back when you knock on the grave. We never found the Werewolf grave so we just chalked it up as being a myth. 
We decided to go back to the car and were talking when L. and B. decided they wanted some alone time (they were a couple back then). I got out of the car and decided to walk around the cemetery by myself. It was a beautiful night with a full moon shining above, ironic I know. I was walking along looking at the old gravestones and thinking of how sad it is that so many people are completely forgotten after they die when I heard a strange sound to my left. I was standing near a mausoleum looking down into another part of the cemetery. I heard the sound again and started walking towards it. It sounded as though something was crunching on something! I stood there for a minute listening. I immediately noticed how quiet it had gotten in the cemetery and the hair stood up on my neck and arms. Usually there is noise from cars or dogs barking or crickets or something like that but there was nothing! I then saw a silhouette of something big and black standing a little ways away from me. Around 25 feet away to be exact. Something told me to back away slowly and leave now but I ignored it. I crept closer to the creature never taking my eyes off of it. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness and I could see very well especially with the moonlight helping light up the night. What I saw terrified me and also peaked my curiosity! The creature first looked like a huge Wolf but the front legs and torso were abnormally large and the back legs were huge as well! It had a long furry tail behind it just like a Wolf’s tail. The head was huge and it had long pointed ears with stuffs of fur at the tips from what I could see and it was leaning down and was eating something. The sounds I had heard was the crunching it made when it bit into whatever it was eating. I was excited because I had always wanted to see a wild Wolf and I thought that was what I was looking at! I figured that maybe a Wolf had escaped the Zoo which was right next door to the cemetery and had caught a rabbit or something. I realized though that the Zoo didn’t have a Wolf in it and hadn't had one in years. That made me even more excited and curious! I stared at the creature for about a minute or so and then I shifted my legs to get more comfortable and I must have stepped on a twig or scuffled my feet because the creature suddenly stopped eating, looked up and turned it's head my way. It then stood up on it's back legs and I heard a loud pop and that is when I realized this was not a huge Wolf! It was black and had a few brownish streaks in it's fur. When it stood up I saw it's head, chest, stomach and lower body. The shoulders and chest were massive and covered in fur that tapered down as you looked at the stomach area and legs. It reminded me of a body builder on steroids because of how muscular it was! As it stood there it started to sniff the air and it stopped and stared my way. The eyes were a deep orange gold and seemed to glow in the moon light. It looked at me and I felt a fear grow deep within me that I had never felt before. I knew it saw me and I knew I had made a huge mistake by not leaving when I first got that bad feeling. It felt as though everything went cold and this creature could see within my soul! It starred at me for a minute and then it opened it's mouth and it bared it's teeth at me as if it were smiling! The teeth were huge and yellowish white and they looked very sharp, just right for ripping it’s prey apart. It never took it's eyes off of me! It then lifted it's arm and took a bite out of whatever it was eating. I then realized the sound I had heard was it crunching bone and tearing flesh as it ate It's ""meal"". The hands were like elongated paws and at the end of each finger were huge black claws that gripped the leg it was eating. I stood there watching it eat for what seemed like hours when it could have only been a few minutes. He never took his eyes off of me!!!The fear I felt overwhelmed me! I felt sick and I was visibly shaking and so I did the one thing I had been taught to never do when confronted with a predator. I turned and ran as fast as I could back to the car! I didn't care. I couldn't get his eyes out of my head and that smile... Those teeth!!! I could imagine it catching me and ripping me to shreds as I ran! I made it to the car though, flung open the door and jumped in screaming for B. to start the car and get us out of there! They asked me what was wrong and I just yelled at them to go now! B. looked at me and saw the terrified look on my face so he started the car and we left and I never went back to that cemetery again. Later that night I told B. and L. what I had seen and they both laughed at me and told me it was just my mind playing tricks on me which made me feel hurt that they didn't believe me but I could hardly believe it myself. I saw a Werewolf or what is referred to as a Dogman and I will never forget it."
Idaho,ID,Minidoka,-113.4902829,42.7537967,,"2013 - I wasn’t there, but my son, son in law, and their friend saw a Dogman. My son called me all freaked out that they had seen a Bigfoot because he knows I believe in Bigfoots. Now, my son always made fun of me for believing in Bigfoots. He asked me, “Dad. Can Bigfoots run on all fours?” I said, “Yes. “Why do you ask?” and he said, “Dad. We just saw one while out spotlighting rabbits. I asked him to describe what it looked like and he said they were hunting rabbits with a spotlight and he saw something hunched over. He said he then yelled to the others and let them know that he had seen something and then started to shine his light on it. At first, he thought it was a large bird because it was down like it was eating something. Then, it stood up on its hind legs and spread its arms out wide and when other two came to look at it, it dropped down and took off faster than anything they had ever seen before. He said it had a dog snout and was covered in fur, but you could see it was very muscular. My son is 6’2 and he felt it stood as tall or taller than him. When it took off, they ran after it and watched it jump and clear a huge rock pile in one leap, like nothing. That scared them and they all ran back to their car, to get out of there.

I spoke to all three and they all had the same story and described it the same way. I told my son that’s not a Bigfoot because Bigfoots don’t have dog snouts. I told him, “You saw a Dogman.” It’s funny that this happened around a lot of corn fields. The area also had caves and was covered in sagebrush."
Kansas,KS,Jackson County,-95.8142885,39.4241422,6/8/2015,"6/8/2015 - Since it was summer break for my school, I was lazily lounging at home watching TV. I got bored, so I went outside to see if I could do anything with my chickens, like feed them worms and snails. Before I go into more detail, I should explain the area I live in. My home is on the outskirts of the city I live in. I had about 5 or 7 chickens at the time, and we hadn’t expanded the coop, so it was a small pen connecting to two sides of the chicken coop, which is wooden and sturdy; the only ways to get into the coop is either through the trap door attached to the big door and the three windows; one window is on one side of the door and the second window on the other side. The third window is a large window. Keep in mind that they all have traps connected to them so they can be closed. We have 7 acres of woodland that we call the “back pasture,” and if you’ve ever been back there you could see that it’s a popular habitat for the local deer; there was also a wild boar that was roaming around at the time, and I don’t know how it got there. We had been having trouble with poachers for a while, considering the population of deer in the woods. One poacher had set up a trail cam, one that was motion-activated. There was an old rusty deer stand that had been put on a tree a long time ago, and the tree had begun to grow around it. Beyond our acres of woods, there’s a large cornfield owned by our neighbors, and beyond that is a forest. I don’t know what the forest is like beyond the field since we’ve never been there. I went outside to do something with my chickens, and I had brought along a bucket of corn for feeding the deer after. When I walked out of my home, I saw a doe was sitting in the tall grass; I thought it was sleeping since it had its head down and wasn’t moving. I, being the curious little nut I was, decided that I would sneak up on the deer and get a picture of it to show to my mother when she got home from work. I crept as silently as I could across the yard that separated me from the deer. I should also mention that we have a clearing with a burn pit in it that was filled with cedar branches. I was creeping across my yard towards the deer, and when I had cleared the burn pit and was about ten yards from it I realized that the deer wasn’t asleep, but it was dead. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen; its intestines were completely gone, the flesh on the body of the doe shredded to pieces and blood absolutely everywhere. It looked as if it had been sitting there for a while, and it smelled like it, too; most of the blood was dried and the air reeked with the stench of rotting flesh, urine, and what seemed like a hint of wet dog. Something that creeped me out about the scene was although it was a rotting carcass, there were no insects at all around it; it was as if the usual lively forest was deader than the deer. Not even the neighbor’s cattle made a sound. It looked as if the poor deer had simply been left after being brutally attacked and half-eaten, which it most likely was. I left the bucket at the beginning of the trail, thinking that I would come out later with my mother and grain the deer when she got home. Then, I started to walk back to my house. I had barely taken a few steps when I heard a low, snarling growl that sounded like a wolf, although it seemed distorted as if it were being played on an old radio(sorry, that’s the only way I think of describing it). Against my better judgment, I turned my head around, and I saw what looked like the biggest freaking wolf I’d ever seen. It was on all fours, its fur was black and matted in places; its face was what you’d expect a wolf to look like, although it was broad and the muzzle seemed a little short, although the way it was curling its lips made it look as if its snout was plenty long, and its eyes were yellow; not a bright yellow like the yellow of a flower or the sun, but a dim, amber, red yellow, if that makes sense. Its ears looked like that of a Doberman pincer, with the cropped effect. Its front legs were long, and it looked as if it were a body builder. Its “paws,” if you can even call them paws, looked like huge hands with long claws at the end of them. It stood up, and I heard the most sickening popping sound you could ever imagine. It sounded like the sound of popping joints, but it seemed amplified as if it were being played through a microphone and the sound was coming out of loud speakers. Its body looked like a body builder’s pumped up on steroids, it was so big. It had no tail, that I could tell, and it seemed to tower over me, although I was a good 10 meters from it. I was about five foot four inches at the time, and I came nowhere close to its height; it was so tall that the tip of its ears could almost touch the top of a young cedar. It let out a loud howl, which sounded more like a roar and it charged at me. Doing the only thing I knew to do while hyped up on fear and adrenaline, I began to run away from it. I remember clearing my yard in what seemed like hours but was most likely only a few seconds, and running inside, slamming and locking all of the doors and windows. As I calmed down a small bit, I had realized that if it had really wanted to kill me that it would have; that what I had experienced was not an attack charge, but a bluff. I was lucky to get away with my life.

Although this happened almost two years ago, it still terrifies me to think about it. The deer was gone the next day, and ever since that evening I have been weary around the woods, only going in them in broad daylight, only when I absolutely had to, and never without a weapon. Sadly, I cannot say that I am one of those people that have stopped experiencing things after the encounter, although I only had nightmares for a month after that day in June. Nothing really started to happen again until about 2 months ago when I was staying up at night playing on the laptop. I had started to hear things moving around on the porch and turned on the light to see the shape of something huge disappearing behind the corner of my house. There was also one of the rare times I went into the woods after the first encounter when I was helping my mother clear brush from the hunting clearing. I was going to get the mower, and was walking the trail to do so when I heard bipedal footsteps following me off to my side; they stopped whenever I stopped, and I eventually ran out of the woods and I haven’t been back since.

I asked my late great grandmother about the creature I had seen in the woods, and she informed me that there was something called the wolf-head man that stalked the Kansa tribe, preying on small children that strayed too far from their tepees. Later, I was informed by my history teacher that my house had actually been built on a tribal burial ground, and I have since been wondering if that had something to do with it. I hadn’t heard about the wolf-head man before she had told me about it; when I saw that there were several eye-witness reports that were proved to be truthful, it made me feel a lot better about coming out with this information. I had attempted to tell people previous to this submission, but everyone either said I was stupid, crazy, or just a plain liar. One thing’s for certain; I am not stupid, I am not crazy, and I am most definitely not a liar. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a Dogman."
Kansas,KS,Jackson County,-95.8142885,39.4241422,9/13/2013,"9/13/2013 - Before I say anything about my encounter, I just want to clarify that when I saw this thing, I went to Google and searched up what it was. I came across this website and found that another person in Jackson County had had an encounter with something like this, so I know I’m not crazy. I’d been studying wolves and their behavior for about 3 years before I had this encounter, and I know that considering Jackson County is about 656 square miles with a population of 674,158 and it being practically infested with wildlife such as deer, livestock, and predators such as coyotes and foxes, it wouldn’t be likely for a large predator such as a wolf to be lurking in the sparse woodland. The average wolf territory is 13 – 2,400 mi², and it’d be easy for such a huge creature to live just in Jackson County alone. This may even be the very same dog-wolf-man thing that the other person saw. Anyway, on to the encounter. I was just chillin’ on the laptop in the living room, watching people blow stuff up, when I felt like I had to go to the bathroom. I set the laptop down and put my headphones on the keyboard and got out of the chair. Let me clarify, I’m not a bloody psychic or a medium or anything, but I have a sort of sixth sense where I can tell if something is watching me, and I knew something was. We have a huge window on the wall just above the couch, and it was a particularly cold night, so the windows caught things like breath fairly well. I turned to the window, thinking that whatever it was watching me from there, and I knew I’d see it if it was(we have motion-sensing floodlights), and it’d have to be either standing on something or tall as the devil himself in order to see into the window of our trailer(it was around 6-8 feet off the ground, with the top of it being about 11 feet). I looked over to the window, and the only thing I could see was that the floodlights were on and something seemed to duck under the window, like a kid playing hide-and-seek. I didn’t think anything of it, considering our neighbors were a sort of druggies and alcoholics and often came to look in our windows, and every opening to the house was locked, so I had nothing to worry about. I went to the bathroom, and when I finished I washed my hands and went back to the laptop. I noticed that the floodlights went out, so whatever it was gone. Not thinking anything else of it, I went back to watching people blow stuff up. I should mention also that my eyes are sharp, sharp enough to spot a bird about 50 feet away in a tree, so it’s no surprise that when the floodlights came back on I noticed immediately. I glanced up from the screen, expecting a drunken or high idiot to be looking in with a stupid expression on his face, but I was frozen by what I saw. It was a huge, huge wolf, that was looking at me with dirty ambery-yellow eyes. Its ears looked like they were torn or Cropped or something, and the face looked sort of human-like. Not really a full human face, but more like the jawline looked very masculine and human compared to the rest of its face. Its lips were curled back and it seemed as if it were snarling, though I couldn’t hear it if it was, and its breath caught on the cold glass. It was so tall that the top of its head was halfway up the window, and if I had to guess how wide it was I’d probably say maybe the width of my shoulders. I knew that whatever it was, it most likely had wolfish instincts, so I did the only thing I knew to do, which was avoid eye contact and make yourself look as small as you could whilst having your throat and underside showing. This is a very common submissive position, and although I was scared out of my mind, I knew that holding eye contact would make me seem like a challenger and running would make me seem like prey. When I did the submissive position it must’ve worked for it to leave me alone because it just hit the window, which made the entire trailer shake, and it went away. I hadn’t heard or seen anything else like it since, although I do hear the odd howl coming from the backroads. God help the poor idiot that decides to try and hunt this thing down. I can tell you know that whatever it was was NOT friendly because if it were, it wouldn’t have slammed my window as hard as it had, and it would not have been growling like I’d taken its food. Although it practically did assault my window, I could understand why it was upset. I was on its territory, after all, an intruder and possibly a threat to its existence and its prey. It’s really just best to stay out if its way and respect it. After all, it is one of God’s many strange creatures in the world."
Kansas,KS,Osage County,-95.6457951,38.6009003,,"Summer 2016 - I was driving home from doing some shopping in a nearby town and was all alone just driving and listening to the radio. It was just before sunset on a beautiful summer day. I was admiring the sky because it was such a bright orange. While driving through some S-curves in the road, I made the first turn and saw some deer dart across the road. Immediately I hit the breaks to slow down, not knowing if there were more to come out of the woods. On the opposite side of the road, it drops down a steep embankment to a farm field. I had slowed the car down and scanned the treeline for more deer. That’s when this thing jumped out of the woods running after the deer. He landed in the middle of the road and cleared the rest of the road in his next stride.

It’s so hard to comprehend what I saw but, it sounds like the descriptions that people have claimed on here. It was a Grey figure with a short sleek coat. I did not see a tail on this creature. It was on all 4s and was the same height as the deer. His head was very odd. It looked like a dog head with cropped pointed ears but had a very short muzzle. He briefly turned his head towards me when he crossed and his eyes…I wouldn’t say they glowed but they weren’t normal animal eyes. They were like dull yellow. And they definitely stood out. His body was what really confused me because the way it moved was like a human would move when trying to run on all 4s. Its gait looked lazy. Like he was just kinda loping across the road. It was very muscular on the front end but had a very thin almost sickly looking abdominal area and hind legs. Once he was across the road I lost sight of him over the embankment. I was so confused as to what I saw that I didn’t tell anyone right away for fear that they would think I was crazy.

I have been searching for answers since then but came up with nothing. I eventually told my husband and one close friend but neither of them had heard of anything that matched my description. I’m still not 100% sure that I saw a Dogman but it is the only thing I have come across that sounds reasonably close to what I saw."
Kansas,KS,Hamilton County,-101.7979613,37.9741668,,"early 2000's - If you know anything about Kansas, you’ll know it’s dry, flat and void of much forestry. As a kid, I lived on a farm in the middle of nowhere. I remember that we had our own play set outside, complete with swings and monkey bars. Nearby was a large patch of overgrown weeds, almost as tall as six feet in some places. I hated playing at the play set, because sometimes, around sunset, I’d see red eyes from within the weed patch. I told my grandparents, but they dismissed it as coyotes. However; one day, I wanted answers and I approached the weeds. Upon closer inspection, I saw a creature that looked similar to a dog, with shaggy white fur. I remember that I thought its front ‘paws’ looked like that of a gorilla’s. The creature moved away from me and I never saw it in that weed patch again.

A year later, I saw the same figure lurking in the dark, outside of the house. I was so paranoid, my mother could not get me to leave the house for a long time, except for going to school. I haven’t seen this humanoid since, nor am I completely sure it is the fabled ‘Dogman’."
Oklahoma,OK,Cleveland County,-97.3516558,35.254964,,"June 2000 - I had been up all night, at a friends house, in the town of Tribby, playing video games. I didn’t want to sleep there, so I said goodbye and headed home. I knew my car was making a funny noise but I thought surely I could get home. Well, I was driving down a long, dark stretch of highway, with nothing but forest and a few sparse country houses. I was coming up to the top of a long hill, when suddenly, my car stops pulling forward. The engine revved but no gears would engage. My CV joint just went out. I was hoping that wouldn’t happen. Well, I had no way of getting it home, so I backed up, down the road, in neutral and off, onto a side road. I thought about staying and sleeping in the car but something told me not to do that. I had an eerie feeling of being watched, so I grabbed my video game case and my machete that I had made from a lawnmower blade and started walking. I kept noticing the feeling of being watched and it felt like I was being followed. I kept looking behind me and saw nothing, but when a car passed by, heading in the direction behind me, it illuminated the area with its headlights and I saw something behind me, in the ditch, hunched down low. It was huge and I could tell it looked animal but had humanoid features. It seemed to have arms but its head was most definitely K9. Its head was very large and its eyes glowed red when the lights hit them. Well, I’ve seen enough werewolf movies to know that this wasn’t a good situation, so I started running. That probably wasn’t the best choice, because I know that predators like to chase things that run from them. When the car had passed, the creature had darted into the trees. I thought that was the best time to run, so I did. I ran for about a quarter mile and looked back but didn’t see anything, so, I kept walking. Well, I kept checking behind me and off to the side, where the treeline was. I knew it was still out there and probably following me and yeah, I was afraid, but I was also prepared to defend myself, with my machete, if need be.

I came up, onto another hill and saw a farmhouse, off in the distance, to my left, down a long, dirt driveway. The moon was almost full and the area around the house was clear, so I could see a guy out there, messing with his truck as I walked by. Then, he turned on a spotlight on his truck and spotted me with it. I kept walking, cause his property said no trespassing and many out there wouldn’t hesitate to unload on a strange trespasser.

I knew it was close again, possibly closer now and I was about to turn around and face it when another car came over the top of the hill and passed by me, going behind me again. I followed with my eyes and noticed this time it was a cop so thinking quickly I dropped my machete on the edge of the grass and waved. As he passed his lights hit the ditch as well and I saw that the Dogman was very close but it darted into the trees again, when the light hit it. Thankfully, a moment later the cop stopped and turned around. He came back and asked me what I was doing out there, so, I told him what happened with my car. I didn’t mention the Dogman, though. He may have thought I was crazy but I asked him for a ride home. He agreed after wanting to go check and make sure my car wasn’t blocking the road. After we checked it, he agreed to take me home.

I don’t know what might have happened that night if he hadn’t shown up and it was the only time I was genuinely happy to see a police officer."

Oklahoma,OK,Tulsa County,-95.940971,36.1593471,,"February 2016 - I heard my dog barking and growling, around 3:00 AM, one night. I got up and went to our back door, to see what she was barking at. When I did, I saw her running up and down the backyard fence line, barking, growling, and urinating, all along the fence, with her tail tucked in. My first thought was, “Predator.” I knew something was wrong. I focused my eyes, to see if I could see what she was barking at and whispered, “Holy $#*#!!” I saw something bent over, in a circle, that was black and looked like it had a mane, like a lion. I looked at it for about 15 seconds and decided to run to the bedroom and get my head-wrapped light. I put it on my head and ran to the back den and saw that it was still there. I carefully turned on the light and shined it right on it. When I did that, it turned around and looked in my direction. Then, it ran down the fence line, with a smaller one in front of it. The best way I can describe it would be to say that it was the size of a lion. It had yellow eyes, pointed ears, huge shoulders and a huge chest. It ran on all fours. Also, this thing was so fast, it only took it about two seconds to run down the fence line. This ""wolf"" was way faster than my dog. I woke up my wife and told her what had just happened. I then went to the computer and Googled “Huge wolves, in America.” Under “Images,” I found a cartoon of a drawing, someone did and its head and mane looked just like what I saw. It was called a Dogman. Today is April 25th, 2016 and I was listening to Episode 90, of your Dogman program, on YouTube. As I was listening, I heard your story, about Darrell Robertson. When you said that happened in a suburb of Tulsa, Oklahoma, I jerked my head around and looked at your website. I decided to give this report to you, so you can warn people about these things."
Oklahoma,OK,Pottawatomie County,-97.0068393,35.275439,,"Back in the early 90's, when i was 19 or so, I worked nights, unloading trucks, at a chain retail department store, back before they turned into super stores. Anyway; several people started to noticed a co worker looked like she wasn't getting any sleep. One night, she told a few of us, on our break, that she was having to leave early and take the long way to work and back home, because of something she saw. She previously always took a road called Moccasin Trail, but one night, the week before, while turning onto that road, on her way to work, she said she saw a huge werewolf sitting in the grass, just watching cars go by. She said she had seen it on four or five occasions and just couldn't take it anymore. She said she was scared this thing was going to follow her, so she just completely avoided that road all together. The way she described the sighting was when she would turn onto this road, her headlights would light up the embankment across the road, just enough so that she could see this big werewolf sitting about 30 feet up on the embankment. She said It would sit in the grass, with its legs stretched out in front of itself. she said it would most often be leaning back, supporting itself on one or both of its elbows, in a kind of leisurely pose, just watching the cars pass by. She really seemed to be sincerely disturbed by her encounter. Over the years, I have heard several stories about strange happenings in that area. The Native Americans talked about staginis and shape shifters in that area. I don't know if that has anything to do with that girl's sightings or not. I just thought it was worth mentioning.? "
Oregon,OR,Linn County,-122.53401,44.4099768,,"March 2017 - It was 2:30 AM and another night of not being able to sleep, due to
back pain. I was lying on my side, reading, when my (very close by)
neighbor’s motion detector light turned on. This happens from time to
time. When it turns on, it lights up the entire side of my house. We have lived here 9 years and I have never once seen anything walk past my bedroom window at night. Since I was facing my large bedroom window, the very bright motion detector light going off caught my attention. I looked up and saw the side silhouette of a Dogman!! I said, “Holy Crap!!” It was walking past my bedroom window. I saw it from mid-shoulders up. The shoulders were huge and its head was huge. It had pointed ears, like a German Sheppard dog and a long snout. Its mouth was slightly open, as I saw a large tongue that seemed to be lolling to the side of its mouth. When I saw this creature and spoke those words, I could swear that thing slowed down, smirked, and then kept going. That’s all I saw that night.

Last week, though, while in my bedroom again, I heard something huge land on the ground, behind my bedroom wall. That wall has no windows. I heard deep, kind of raspy breathing. I started praying, pleading the blood of Jesus over my house, grounds around it, and all. I do this most nights, but sometimes I forget.

I’m awake most nights until 3 AM or later, due to having severe spine issues, as well as Fibromyalgia. We live in a lovely manufactured home community. There are lots of trees around here and it’s VERY close to canals, large open fields, and woods. I know this is what I saw, but the fact that I saw it has left me amazed. Why is that, when so many are also seeing them? I guess I just thought since I am in the house most of the time, due to my health, I would never see them.

The space between my neighbor’s house and ours is about 10 feet. My husband went outside weeks later (once I got the courage to tell him this had happened) and measured the area by the window. That Dogman had to be at least 8 feet tall. What concerns me greatly is that no one in the Police department or government will alert people to their existence. People are walking around feeling a false sense of security. I know I did! I won’t even try to walk outside anymore and yes, I have cautioned my neighbors… The ones with the security light.

I can’t think of any other details right now, but it’s important for you to know that several years ago, a homeless woman was camping out, down by the river, here in Albany. She was found dead and her tent was really torn up. I believe the police report in the newspaper said she was torn up as well, but I honestly can’t remember any of the details. To the best of my knowledge, no one was ever caught for that crime. This is a sleepy town, just over 50,000 people. We no longer get the newspaper, so I have no idea if this has happened again. I do know that a couple was down by that same area and saw a Dogman. It really frightened them badly. I heard about that on another YouTube channel. I just want people to be aware, so they don’t go out at night anymore, especially near the river! But then, we’re not near a river and I saw one in the middle of the night.

Thank you for reading this report, and for doing all that you do, to make people aware of what is really going on out there!"
Montana,MT,Carbon County,-109.100255,45.2820195,8/15/2004,"8/15/2004 - I'm probably the youngest person to come to you about this. I'm 16, grew up here in Montana, and am very active in the outdoors. When I was 4 or 5, I lived with my parents, in a small town, next to the highway. Our house was right next to it and my room faced a gravel road, that went into the highway. It was summer and we didn't have AC, so I would leave my window open at night, so I could stay cool. One night, I woke up and noticed a shilouette, standing outside my window. My eyes focused and I saw that it had a furry outline and these frost blue eyes it was using to look at me. I sat up in my bed, frightened, but I didn't feel the need to yell for my parents or anything. It just kind of stared at me. While looking at it, I saw that it had pointed ears, with tufts of fur, like lynx have, and a muzzle like a German Shepard. It was fairly muscular and was almost resting on my window sill, like it was leaning up against it. We stared at each other for a good couple of minutes. Then, it smiled at me, like a dog does and even tilted its head. It then backed away from my window, walked across my yard, to our chain link fence, and literally stepped over it. I got out of bed, to watch this thing as it got down on all 4's, and ran down the road, and across the highway. Listening, I heard it yip and bark while on the other side, which was prairie, with a butte and then forest. It was almost like it was calling to others. Looking back on this, I feel like maybe it felt like I didn't pose a threat. Maybe it was just curious. Back then, I was just a little kid. Now I'm a lot bigger. I'm 6'7 and weigh almost 200, so I'm thinking if I saw one of these again, I probably wouldn't get the same reaction. "
Nebrasksa,Nebrasksa,Douglas County,-96.195132,41.3148116,10/5/2016,"10/5/2016 - My brother and I were waiting for our bus, at our usual corner stop. It’s about 3 blocks away from our house and there’s a pretty densely wooded creek nearly 1-2 blocks behind our bus stop. The first thing I noticed that was off was that my brother was standing completely rigid, staring intently down the long road (there are only two street lights and a few automatic porch lights down there). I shook him a little bit and asked what he was looking at. He shushed me almost immediately. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a large, black shape darting on 2 legs across the street, to the line of houses on the other side, before disappearing. Thankfully, our bus arrived soon afterward, so we got out of there."
Nevada,NV,Mineral County,-118.4863963,38.4343464,,"Date Unknown - I grew up in a town called Hawthorne, located in Nevada. Hawthorne is located right next to Walker Lake. The main highway leading from Hawthorne to Reno is Hwy 95, which if you use Google Earth, you can see runs right between Walker Lake and a mountain range. This creates a small area of the highway that is affectionately known to locals as ""The Cliffs."" When I was 14, my grandparents, mom, and I were coming home late from a long day of doctor's appointments in Reno. My grandfather was driving, and we hit The Cliffs a little after 11:30pm. I was in the passenger seat, to help keep my grandfather awake, but I still think it was just so I would sing folk songs with him. Anyway, about 1/3 of the way around The Cliffs, heading toward Hawthorne, there is a small area where the road pulls away from the mountain and creates a small out-cove area. As we started to come up on it, we saw a large animal crossing the road, dragging another animal in its mouth, and it stopped in this out-cove. Grandpa thought, at first, that I might get my first look at a live mountain lion, so he slowed down. When we got within 100 feet of it, he turned on the brights of the car. To our surprise, it was no mountain lion. We only had a couple of seconds to look at it after grandpa turned on the brights, because right after the light hit what ever the hell that thing was, it turned to look at us one second, and the next, it lept straight up the side of the mountain, and out of sight, leaving the mangled body of a fox. Grandpa hit the gas and the old Buick we were in jumped, waking up the women in the back seat. I had never seen my grandfather truly scared before, but even he was physically shaking afterward. I remember the sheer bulk of the thing, and the fact that it looked like a really large bodybuilder., when it jumped in the same fashion as a human, with its arms reaching up, toward the rocks almost over its head. It had long, thick fur, but you could see the muscle definition. I don't remember the facial features, but I remember the pure terror when that thing turned and looked at the car with shining yellow eyes. I even pissed myself! I have come practically face to face with a polar bear, and I wasn't as scared as when we saw this thing. Now I don't believe in werewolves, and I haven't seen anything like it since, but I hope I never do again!"
New Mexico,NM,Eddy County,-104.4723301,32.4170622,,"April 1999 - For some background info, I was raised in the deserts, southeast of New Mexico, on two different ranches, so I am very well versed in the flora and fauna of our beautiful state. I even used to track semi-professionally for hunters and our local trapper. I KNOW the critters around this state! We always lived on very remote ranches, 50, sometimes 75 miles from the nearest actual town. My Senior year of high-school, I moved out on my own, being a part of the DECCA program, to live closer to my job and school. Living about 12 miles from Artesia NM, where my school and job were, seemed like living right in town after all of that!

I guess my story starts in April of 1999. My boyfriend and I were rooming with a couple, in a trailer house, just outside of Lakewood NM. We rented a room from them and sometimes watched their two kids, as part of our rental agreement. For a few weeks that April, a lot of the neighboring landowners had been complaining about wild dogs coming up from the river and harassing their dogs and scaring their livestock (We were about a mile from the Pecos river, and wild dogs have indeed been a problem in the area.) One guy had even reported some structural damage to one of his chicken coups. The couple we lived with had two dogs, both of them medium sized terrier mixes, and neither one of them were on the cowardly side. They had been getting VERY skittish about going outside at night, though. So much so that we had to make sure to let them out right at sunset, and again at sunrise, because they would NOT leave the trailer house otherwise, at night.

One Saturday night, at about 11 PM (I know it was a Saturday, because I had neither work or school), near the end of the month, the four of us were sitting around, watching TV, and just basically talking about stuff, when the dogs (who were asleep in the master bedroom, on the far east side of the house) started growling and barking at the window on the south wall of the bedroom. This was really unusual behavior for them, so we all got up to see what they were on about. By the time we got there, the dogs had shifted their barking away from the window and seemed to be barking at the wall and along the wall, like they could smell something there, but it was moving. It was VERY strange and when they came up to the end of the room, their barking just went crazy. Suddenly, from farther down the wall, at the same time (about where the kitchen was), we all heard this loud thump and scuffling sound. It was powerful enough that we actually felt it (with it being an 80×16 trailer house and all). The dogs, at this point, just completely lost it. They cried out a high-pitch whine and just dove under the bed. We all ran out of the bedroom, down the hall, and into the kitchen, to see what the heck was up. Peering out the kitchen window was pointless, as it was late, there was cloud-cover and the moon wasn’t even out. We heard the scuffling noise again, from further down the house, and went into the living room to see what was up. We were all really confused at this point. The next few moments seemed to happen in slow motion. Appearing in the living room window from the left and looking right in on us from the glass was… I don’t know what. From the shoulders up was what I can only describe as a man-dog. Its shoulders were quite human, with short sleek hair, but it had the head of what looked to be a Rottweiler. And the teeth… Oh my GOD! The teeth on this thing! All four of us screamed at about the same time and I guess that scared it off, because it just disappeared. That image is forever seared into my head! Also of note, this was a trailer house, so the bottom of that window was easily six foot off the ground, meaning this thing was seven-foot something! No matter how big of a dog or wolf it was, it could not have stood up and looked at us like that, in that window. The guys (being guys) immediately grabbed their shotguns and headed out the door, even though I told them it was a bad idea. (Super dark desert night? Big unknown critter? Uggggh, NO!) I guess they were out there looking around for it for some 20 minutes before they came back inside and said they couldn’t see anything. The light from the house shining on it and it being so close to the window were the only reasons we saw it in the first place. None of us really slept well that night. It just felt creepy!

The next morning, I got up early and decided to go have a look around, to see if there were any tracks to identify what the heck it was. The grass and weeds that were right beside the house pretty much hid any tracks it made there. Although, I did find where it looked as if something had clawed at the siding, along the bottom of the house, in a couple of places, making the thump and scuffling sounds, the night before. I then decided to follow the tracks the guys had made and that was when I made a second, very unnerving discovery. The guys made clear tracks in the sandy dirt and whatever it was out there did as well, because it was pretty much circling them the entire time they were out there, at a distance of about forty feet. The tracks were HUGE, canine, and switched back and forth from four tracks to two, meaning it was walking bipedally for at least half the time it circled them.
Just freaking creepy!"

Dogman in Collin county,TX
Dogman Sighting details::
On April 4th of this year(2018) I came back from work around midnight. Like most nights I sat down on my back porch and lit a cigarette and relaxed. However unlike most nights I heard something new. I am used to coyotes, and my neighbors dogs barking, but in this case I heard something new. It sounded like a deep howl, but instead of the usual dog sound it stayed as one tone and it was octaves deeper. I heard it go from backyard to backyard and the neighbors dogs took notice. The dogs barking triggered one of my dogs to run out to the fence line and she began to bark at something unseen(at least from my perspective) I got up and I told her, ""Hey come back in girl its ok"". She turned to me and she sat there utterly frozen in fear. It took a few minutes to break her out of this, and she bolted to the back door. I decided to poke my head out of the gate and look into the field behind the fence. By the treeline I saw these amber colored eyes standing about 5 ft above the ground. I decided to run in and took up my knife and ran out in the direction of the eyes. The whole time I walked I heard the howls. However though when I got close to where I initially saw these eyes, every sound stops. You could literally hear a pin drop. Where I didn't see anything, I felt the presence of something watching me. After a few moments I walked back to the porch and sat and had another smoke. It was then the howls started again...This time though thy came from my neighbors backyard. They have two shepherds and I will never forget this sound. I first heard this guttural growl noise unlike anything I've heard before, then one of the shepherds shrieked and then I heard the other get slammed against the fence. One thing lad to another and I heard my neighbor fire off a round and then I heard this thing trail off. The next encounter was just three nights ago. I heard the howls start up again, but this time I heard it making its way through the treeline behind the back lot of my house. I heard the thumping of its feet, and branches were snapping.My instincts kicked in to get to cover so I shut off the back porch light and allowed my eyes to get adjusted. There was enough light to clearly see the opening in the treeline that's about two of me wide, and about 9+ ft high. I watched in the direction where the noises were coming from then all of a sudden I see it stand up. I first saw the ears tall and sharp like knives. I then saw its head,followed by its broad shoulders and long arms. It stood there watching me for what seemed like forever until it turned and ducked down a little, and took massive strides on two legs to walk off. Its because of this I've been conducting an investigation on this thing. I learned there was an encounter in Firestone county not very far from me. I hope to get reasonable evidence soon.

Texas,TX,Johnson City,-98.4119811,30.2767408,,"After attending a matter in Austin during the day, I decided to camp out near Pedernales Falls State Park in a private ranch that I won't name (lady there was really nice and don't wish her any bad business). It was after dark--about 6:30pm last Friday, November 18, 2016 when I was invited to explore and set up camp anywhere on the property. I went to the most isolated part in the back near a creek. Once in the area, I heard screams made by people--approximately two males and one or two females. At first I thought to myself ""Damn, I'm going to have to hear these drunks yell all night as they blast off their primal scream therapy routine."" They had set a campfire below next to the creek. I was about 150 yards away, high up near the ledge. The creek ran about 10 yards below me and I caught a glimpse of their fire but not of the people. Only quick shadows darted past the flames. It was odd but I did not think much of it at the time. I proceeded to return to my area where I'd parked my car and gather firewood. I ignored the screams that these folks were making... yet I noticed that I never once heard talking or voices commenting normal language.... just screams that kept getting more intense and strong and long (in duration). Still, I did not think of it as being too weird. I kept about my business trying to set up my camp and my tent in the dark. After struggling, flashlight in my mouth, and knees scraped from laying out the bedding in the tent, I walked around enjoying the open view of the sky. By now, the screams had turned to barking and howling. Earlier during my wood gathering forage I had heard someone walking in the darkness and I assumed it to be a female person who probably had strayed from their perimeter to got to the bathroom. I spoke to the person in the dark mentioning that I would be setting up camp in this upper area away from them. The person never answered so I felt confident I had established a respectful territorial mark where I would not go near them and they, in turn, would not come close to me. Nevertheless, I still did not think anything was weird up to that point. What began to worry me was when an hour later, as I was about to begin my fire, and rest in my tent, three or four howls united into a very loud crescendo. That got my attention. The barking now as more intense and deeper. At first I thought that maybe these people were using dogs to fight each other but it was not like that. In dog fights you can listen to dogs tearing into each other and the voices of the men cheering on. Here, the barking seemed to be going in one direction, as if the dogs or coyotes were competing to outdo each other with barks, wailing, and howling. As my mind tried to comprehend what was going on another possible scenario appeared to my reasoning capability--maybe they had set up speakers and were playing a recording of barks and howls... but it made no sense. Once again, the barking deepened and the howling became more fierce and louder. That when I decided that I would not be able to sleep there at all; besides, the sounds did not appear to be human-based at all. I collapsed the tent I had struggled to set up (for almost an hour) and left the stone ring and all the firewood of different lengths and thickness stacked and ready. A sense of self-preservation came over me as I was alone, unarmed except for a long, heavy machete I gripped with my right hand. Before leaving I crept as far as i could to the ledge where earlier I had seen their campfire but the barking and howling was too great. I crept up quietly in defensive combat mode only 25 yards further (did not reach the 50 yard mark at the ledge where I'd been two hours earlier). How I wished to have my tape recorder box with batteries so that my wife could hear what I was hearing). Like I said, I could not go any deeper or closer to them because the things voicing out the barking and howls were not people. I never saw them."
Texas,TX,Freestone County,-96.1526985,31.7534889,4/23/2016,"4/23/2016 - I was out at my grandparent’s house, hunting coyotes, as usual, this time of year. I was hiking through my next door neighbors land, to get to the wood-covered land in the back. While I was hiking, I got the feeling I was being followed by something to my right. I stopped and switched the red tint on my headlamp to my spotlight but didn’t see anything. Then I switched back to my headlamp and pulled my rifle back up and continued my hike.

It was 6:15 AM and the sun was just coming up. I was sitting in a hide I’d made the day before. That’s when I saw something behind a group of trees on my left. It was crouched. I raised my rifle, looked through my scope and froze when I saw the creature staring back at me. I panicked and fired a shot off. That’s when it stood up and took off, deeper into the woods. I sat there probably another 25 mins before I decided it was safe to head in and did so. Later that day, I grabbed my grandfather and we both went out to where I had seen the creature when it stood up on 2 legs and took off. We measured where I had seen it and it was roughly 7 1/2 feet tall.

To this day, I’m terrified to go out at night or in the early morning hours."
Texas,TX,Roscoe,-100.5387183,32.445952,,"Date Unknown -  the first encounter was when i was young trying to fall asleep i looked out the window and saw it, out towards the backyard faced my window at the time, now a days i sleep in the basement, back on topic my brother and I always felt nervous looking out that window,. My bed perfectly faced the window at the time the beast was 3 feet away looking into the window, , It had yellow eyes, long snout of a dog, black fur, it face is kinda human subtract the snout and the gnarly long teeth, and fur all over it's face, once it realized I noticed it, it snarled at me quietly through the window and it was a stare down, i slowly pulled the covers over my head. I then proceeded to cry for what felt like forever,then i ran into my parents room crying. telling me it was just a dream. I thought that for what was like 8 years until my sophomore year in high school when My brother, my friend and I were out fishing. My brother loved peanut butter at the time he brought a plate with a giant serving size spoon glob and some Ritz crackers. There's a creek back there, surprisingly some decent fish, mostly chub, but there is bullhead, carp, green bellied sunfish, crayfish, snapping turtles, Brown trout but that's really rare to catch there, we sometimes thought it be funny to throw the chub there and leave them there at our favorite spot, A giant Fallen oak tree which acts like a natural bridge across the creek it fell due to the amount weight it was bearing that due to a bad snowstorm. My friend and i went down stream one summer's day, meanwhile my brother was fishing alone, He went to go take a leak, he left the the food on the other side of the creek, when came back he saw it running off with, he described as more of a Bigfoot, He ran to us hysterical, we just thought he was crazy so started calling him crazy Joey. After that i thought of my run in with something similar at the young age the stare down. Later My friend was busy with lawn work and prepping to move. i was secretly afraid to go out. Joe decided to come back there a month later, he left by himself i wish i could saw to confirm my story. But the second time around i believed him for sure. He was catching some fish, his line was all screwed up and took it off his fishing and re-spooled it he ran come because he only had one hook on the pole. He ran back and claimed he the same thing chasing the bird that was wrapped up, he yelled scared it, then ran back home for knife as fast as he can, then cut it free. I seen something similar To my sighting, My brother, my friend and some others were going to fish at a illegal spot we didn't know it was private property at the time, whenever me and my friends try out new spots we have tradition casting bass lures first, then use normal live bait. I wanted to hesitate because the fish were biting there pretty good at the creek. So sure enough they went ahead me across the oak tree towards the quarry. I felt alone after 12 minutes then i took my bag, 2 poles, and tackle i was changed out close to the log. I started walking and saw what I thought to be a big grey wolf easily waist me being 5.6? In IL meh anythings possible my friend got cornered by 4 coyotes out there once, But sure enough the creature by another giant oak tree and i made eye contact again another stare down only different since it was on all fours. It was obviously interested in my friends since it was following the trail that leads there, I yelled and chased it, the look on its face was playful because it was probably pretending not to notice me, so i chased it to the clearing, the retention ponds are on the left and a small prairie on the right. It seemingly went towards the prairie. Sure enough i quickly forgot when one my friends caught a pig of large mouth that weighed 3 1/2 pounds on the first cast. I waited until we were going to leave to inform them because i didn't want ruin the fact we were catching bass on every cast. But the guard working there gave us a warning told us to get out there and this private property etc. I told them they didn't believe me. The last time we saw something similar, Me and My brother were scavenging for roadkill when saw a Black dog/maybe it look at us ran away constantly back it moved gracefully through the brush meanwhile me and my brother were absolutely getting torn up by the razz berry bushes. We catch up it waits then runs away again, we played this game 5 times with that thing, then we couldn't find it again. I live Roscoe enjoy being outside i notice strange things out in that woods, people usually just kick the roadkill off the highway it can cause an issue if it's big enough like a deer, but i notice something went out of it's way to drag them out to the prairie coyotes maybe, the thing sure why not, theirs plenty of deer, Turkey, Rabbits, You can even hear the coyotes get excited when they catch a poor rabbit at night."
Washington,WA,Snohomish County,-122.0981848,47.9128756,,"1997-98 - My first encounter happened late at night, while driving home to Snohomish from Sultan...the two towns being about ten miles apart. I was with my mother and we had just finished dropping a friend off at her home in Sultan. It was late October and there was an unusual storm going on that night that everyone talked about the following day. Tremendous cloud-to-cloud lightning and a very cold dry wind with no rain. Bright flashes of light, loud thunder and lots of leaves blowing around. After dropping our friend off, we were on a stretch of the road that's very dark, with farmland on either side of the highway (Hwy 2) and both sides having densely wooded hills. We were driving a 1991 Honda Accord and at this one particular spot in the road, somethingcaught my eye, off to the left side, which was a farm field and there was a break in the guard rail for a dirt road going into the field. Right when we were even to this break, I saw what looked like a huge dog coming up, and right then, it ran in front of our car and I hit it...we could see the top of it's back, which we both swear looked more like a hyena at this point than a dog! It had to be huge to see it's back over the hood of the car, when you're sitting pretty low to the ground in a Honda Accord! It's fur was shaggy brown and mottled with dark spots, just like a hyena and it's front seemed higher up than its back. The headlights lit it up as it ran right in front of our car and we could feel it get hit, but didn't see it go either up in the air or off to the right side of the car. It was running from the left side of the highway to the right. We were driving westward. It sent my car into an uncontrollable swerve back and forth into the oncoming lane and I just prayed that I could get it under control, to keep from getting into a head-on collision with what looked like maybe a Ford Aerostar van. A calmness came over me and I felt like my guardian angel had taken control of the steering, because we missed the van by just a few inches. After going a little ways further, we were both so shook up I pulled off to the side. My mother wanted to go look for the ""dog,"" because we both love animals and felt bad about hitting something...BUT...I had a bad feeling about looking for this ""dog,"" because it had looked so strange and I was afraid of it. It was dark and stormy. It didn't feel safe and I just wanted to get home. We got back in the car and stopped at a little gas station, when we first got into Monroe, which is the next town between our town and Sultan. We got out, to look at the front of my car, thinking surely there would be some evidence of hitting something that large (we were going the highway speed when we hit it which is 60mph), like a dent, some fur or blood, but there was NOTHING there. Not a scratch! The whole thing had a very supernatural feel to it. The look of this ""dog"" which was huge and looked more like a hyena just didn't seem right. Neither did the timing of it running in front of us, like it WANTED to make us stop on that dark stretch of road and get out of my car, which we did, but we got right back in! I never saw it on two legs. It ran on all fours, but there was something so calculated about the way it came up to the highway and looked at our car and ran in front of it. It seemed planned. It was such a strange electromagnetic type of storm that night too. The next day, people we knew that lived miles and miles apart in many different directions all talked about the storm and one particularly loud thunder clap, that shook everyone's homes. They all thought it was directly over their house but they were all miles apart. I have three more encounters which occurred after this first one. I'm pretty sure this happened October 1997...no later than 1998."

It was around 1 or 2 am when he saw what he said was a huge dog traverse down the slope on the south side of the road and commense to run along side his pickup. He was driving a 69-70 Ford F150 highboy which came from the factory lifted. The dogman was running with him at 35-40 mph. Theres a 2-3ft barrow ditch running along the road and the dogmans head was level with his as he was driving so Jon puts its height at 7 to 8 ft. It was dark in color with grey or white on its muzzle running from its nose to under its eyes which were amber in color. He sped up to 45 and the dogman kept up with him often looking inside the pickup. He said at around 50mph he lost it and thats all he would tell me.

Dogman Plus Other Crypts On My Place For Years
Dogman Sighting details::
Hi folks. I do not want my name out on the internet because it never goes away. Anyway, a few years ago I decided to contact the BFRO about having Yetis' (Bigfoot) on my place. I call them Yeti because they have three toes instead of five. I always knew we had more than one cryptid on the place. I live on a river, and have about 18 acres of land. The dogman has been sighted off Lime Road which also borders my river. I am from Pueblo, Colorado and I live on the St. Charles River which dumps into the Arkansas River. My researchers had me put out cams to see if I could catch any Bigfoot activity. I did, and over the years have caught other strange creatures on cam. I call them hybrids. My encounters started when I was 8 years old in 1969 when a huge Bigfoot stood up in front of my dads Allis Charmers Tractor and it has continued to this day with other creatures as well. I have a pic of the dogman I caught in the river. It takes up a span of four feet wide. He has huge shoulders and is staring directly at the camera across from it. Yes, it is black, has ears that tip in towards themselves, and scars on its face and it appears he is not too happy about having his picture taken. I felt very vindicated when I got that pic and I blew it up in word so I could get a good look at the creature. Quite ugly to say the least. It is a daylight pic, right about when the sun is setting. Good pic anyway. In the pic he is not standing but buffed out squatting, looking at the cam. That's not all guys. I keep my big dogs in at night because I don't want them killed. I have an older Blue Heeler and an Irish Wolf hound mix. He's not as big as an Irish Wolf hound but non the less is fast and aggressive. I almost lost him last fall he was three at the time. I came home and he wasn't there to greet me. I found him pretty beat up with a 6 inch slice at his groin which almost cut into his phenol artery. He had no bite marks at all, but he was beat all over his body like something pulverized him. He was so swollen that you could push in on the swelling like you were pushing in on semi inflated balloon. I called my pasture neighbor who indeed said there was a fight in the river at about 9:00 am.She said it sounded horrible and heard a dog screaming. Well, I said it was my dog. It changed my dogs personality, he is more cautious, and when these creatures are around will not leave my side nor will he venture to the river. Irish Wolf hounds are ear, sight, and smell dogs and when he stands on his hind legs or raises his head smelling the air and turns around and comes back to me, something is a foot in the river. I have had many instances with these creatures on my place and I have lost a few good dogs to that river and what runs it. If you want the pic send me an e-mail. My researchers are mostly into Bigfoot and do not come around much anymore. Matter of fact, one moved away to another part of Colorado. They are cryptologists. Gentlemen, be very careful with going into the woods with these things. I can prove these creatures, and the others are not what we know as normal animals. Dogmen are very hard to kill as well as Bigfoot or as well as the other creatures on my place. I hope you carry a very large caliber weapon when out humping it in the woods. I have a pic of a hybrid that has kind of an ape like face, huge shoulders, not much body and African lion feet. You can see four shadows in that pic and it's quite a pic. Broad daylight, bright morning, and when I sent it to my researchers they added some color to the pic to see the creature better and sent it back to me. This is why I say dogman, Bigfoot and the other crypts out there are giants of old. I saw something last summer, but your text box won't let me type any further. E-mail me if you care too. They are dangerous friends, never doubt that.
