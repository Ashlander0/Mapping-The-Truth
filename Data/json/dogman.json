I never had the faintest explanation for it until a couple months ago, when I randomly stumbled across Dogman on the internet. I was in my early 20s, working swing shifts at the time and commuting about 100 miles each way, so it was usually around 2:00 in the morning by the time I got home. I saw the 'monster' (as I called it) on the northern-most section of Trunk Road in the Matanuska Valley, in Alaska. This area is roughly smack in between the towns of Palmer and Wasilla. I was only about 10 miles from home at that point, so it must have been around 2:00 a.m. Trunk Road is a narrow, 2-lane road, consisting of nothing but twists and turns. The surrounding terrain is somewhat swampy and thick with black spruce. It was late October; days before Halloween. There was no snow on the ground, but it was cold enough to be wary of ice. I was driving an '82 Subaru SW, going about 20 MPH around a curve, when my headlights caught a large, dark figure up ahead. I'm bad at judging distance; maybe 6 car lengths away. I instinctively let off the gas, coasting closer. At first I assumed it was a moose, as the area is infested with them; but no, it was standing upright. Bear, then. No, not a bear. It looked so strange... tall enough to be an uncommonly large bear, but far too slender, and it looked like it had spikes running down its neck and back. A Halloween prop? Odd but effective place for one. All those thoughts ran through my head in a fraction of a second. The car was still coasting closer and I could see more details; it was standing in profile, gazing across the road. I could clearly see its wolfish muzzle, large, upright ears; the 'spikes' on its back were in fact clumps of fur. Its spine curved in a smooth, very natural-looking way. It was standing in the ditch, inches from the pavement. Because I was focused on its upper body, I do not recall anything about its back legs or if it had a tail. I did see its front legs though; very 'doggy' looking, hanging awkwardly down and slightly toward its front, exactly as you'd expect if a dog stood upright. While it clearly had a canine look, there was still something 'off' about it that I cannot articulate. It was perfectly still, and at this point, given the proximity to Halloween, I was quite convinced it was some sort of Halloween prop, because it was clearly not any kind of existing animal. I was deeply impressed and gently stepped on the brakes, intending to stop and examine it closely. Then it turned its head towards me. In the tiny fraction of a second that it took for it to swivel its head, I knew I had made a terrible mistake. The fluidness of its movement removed any and all doubt that this was some kind of prop. It was horribly, terrifyingly alive. The pale, off-white glow of its eyeshine in the headlights destroyed any possibility of a human in a costume. I think I sat there gaping at it in shock for a few seconds, the car barely moving by now, but still inching closer. As I was almost upon it---I think it could have leaned forward and touched the car if it had wanted---I had to look up to see its face; again I'm a bad judge of such things, but I am 5'4\" and it was a hell of a lot taller than me. Tall like a polar bear standing. 7 feet? 8? I really can't say. I snapped out of my trance and slammed on the gas. The car fishtailed and I prepared myself for death-by-monster, as I was certain I'd end up in the ditch, but the tires caught the pavement and I drove like a complete maniac all the way home. I did not look back. I have only been on that section of road a few times since, never alone and never in the dark. For the next several years of driving that commute, I went 20+ miles out of the way to avoid Trunk Road. The thing never made any aggressive moves, but there was something about it that felt very... I don't know... predatory. I never saw anything remotely like it again and never heard any stories about it in the area."},"1":{"state":"Ohio","state_abbrev":"OH","location":"Canton","longitude":-81.378447,"latitude":40.7989473,"date":"11\/23\/2016","summary":"11\/23\/2016 - After digging into what I had seen on google, I had come across your name associated with the words \"dog\" and \"man\" .. along with werewolf Ohio several times.

My grandfather owned a cabin. I\u2019m not disclosing the location of it, due to the fact that I don\u2019t want anything to happen to anyone. Anyway; my grandfather\u2019s cabin was his way of getting the family together for the holidays, so he could have a nice Sunday dinner with all of us.\n\nOne day, all of a sudden, that all stopped abruptly. He wouldn\u2019t allow anyone, but himself, to visit the cabin we all looked forward to going to and cherished. For years, I would ask him why he was doing that. He never told me why, but when he passed, he left the place to me. I inherited the cabin of my childhood and was ecstatic about that. It was soon after that, I realized why he did what he did. I would go out and walk the woods, on game trails, which are everywhere. I know these woods like I know my own home, so I never had any reason to fear them. It was on one of these walks that I encountered what people call \u201cDogmen.\u201d\n\nI was walking, just like any other time. Nothing was different. It was then, on one of the game trails, I noticed an offshoot, small trail that went only 6 to 7 feet back. I could see that something had bedded down there. I thought it was a deer. I then walked in the bedded area. I soon realized that this was an ambush point for whatever made this bedded area and it was massive! My arm hairs stood erect and a chill literally ran down my spine! I felt as if I was being watched from different vantage points. Since it was nighttime, I had a tracking flashlight and my sidearm. The latter of which I drew and kept at the ready. I genuinely feared for my life at this point. All of a sudden, an ungodly growl was made to my right, about 10 to 15 yards from me (very close indeed). I pissed myself. It was so terrifying! I didn\u2019t immediately run, fearing that whatever it was might take me as threatening. I turned and started heading back on the main trail and when I was about 5 minutes from the back door of my cabin, this thing let out a howl that I swear felt like it went right through my body! I then proceeded to run. As soon as I did, this thing was chasing me. For every 5 steps I took, this thing was taking 1. That\u2019s how fast this Dogman was! I heard the sounds of branches being ripped off trees and I could have sworn I felt the vibrations of it running after me. I barely made it to my cabin and slammed the door, locking the 2 deadbolts and chain lock. I then turned on my spotlight and shined it into the tree line. There were 3 sets of eyes in the tree line that shined vivid yellow, with enormous, black pupils! I felt as if the thing could read my mind, but I\u2019m not sure it could.

I have always loved nature\u2026 I love the woods, I love hiking and camping, fishing, I\u2019m really into mycology so I\u2019m out looking for mushrooms and various types of fungus whenever I get a chance. The weather was absolutely beautiful on Monday for this time of year, so towards evening time, I decided to round up some of my walleye gear and head down to an old train trestle crossing the Mahoning river in Niles, Ohio. I had parked my car about a mile and a half from the trestle so I could walk the tracks and hit a few other spots along the river on my way down there. By the time I reached the trestle, it was pretty much dark. I was wearing a headlamp at the time so I had a depending light source. At this location, there is a lake directly across the river, which the two are connected by a small overhead dam. I was there for 15 min when all of the sudden, this overwhelming feeling of dread came over me. I switched my headlamp on to turn around to start back up the river bank, and right behind a big sycamore tree, I saw what looked to be a VERY LARGE ANIMAL, kind of kneeling beside\/behind it. As I locked my eyes on it, I completely froze. I knew I was definitely seeing something there, but my mind couldn\u2019t process it. What I was looking at didn\u2019t make any fucking sense. The thing that I kept saying to myself was, \u201cAnimals aren\u2019t supposed to look like that.\u201d Right as I\u2019m thinking this, it\u2019s as if this thing read my mind, STOOD UP, and made itself perfectly visible in the most pretentious way. It almost had this vibe like, \u201cYeah, now you see me, you know I\u2019m real, I definitely exist\u2026 What are you gonna do about it?\u201d And as soon as it happened, it kind of hunched over and made its way into the brush. I was out of there LIKE A FLASH. As soon as my feet hit the tracks, I ran and ran the entire way back to my car, without stopping. By the time I reached my car, I couldn\u2019t breathe. Both my legs were locked up. I was vomiting and somewhere in between the encounter and running away, I had pissed myself. It\u2019s early Friday morning now, and I think I\u2019ve only slept for about 6 or 7 hours altogether. I\u2019ve been constantly searching YouTube and all kinds of stuff, listening to eyewitness accounts, and it sounds like these things are encountered quite often. I\u2019ve heard of the \u201cDogman\u201d before but never really took it seriously. Before the night of this encounter, I would always picture a dogman to look like some little skittish, coyote looking creature. Man\u2026 I love the woods and I love nature. The woods for me was always a safe haven I could venture into, to escape stress. Stress at work, bills, relationship problems\u2026 I could always take a nice long hike, go fishing or foraging and come home feeling 75% better. Now, I feel like I was threatened and kicked out if my second home. The only thing I can keep thinking is, these things aren\u2019t supposed to exist. I feel like a terrified little kid who just came face to face with the dreaded \u201cmonster in the closet\u201d. You know, the monster you parents told you, no wait, ASSURED YOU, wasn\u2019t real and couldn\u2019t hurt you. People need to be made aware of these things. They are as REAL as it gets and they are dangerous. Thinking back to what this thing looked like and how it was built, these things are perfectly adapted killing machines. The way the arms and legs looked, it looked like it was perfectly adapted to walk on all fours as well as on two legs, it was sooo quiet and fluent with its movements also. It\u2019s not like in the movies where the monster comes charging out of the woods, growling and snarling, these things are are masters of camouflage and they utilize the darkness perfectly. I didn\u2019t notice a smell from it, probably because the wind was on my back at the time, but it sure smelled me. Its nose was up in the air the whole time of our encounter, just sniffing away. This experience has torn a huge hole in me. Every time I eat, I get nauseous, I can\u2019t sleep for more than 20 min. at a time, and every time I close my eyes, that thing is all I can see. I\u2019m trying not to dwell in the fear, I\u2019m trying to accept what I saw and what had happened, but it\u2019s hard.

This is a place with heavy foot traffic and located in an urban setting the area is also bordered by Mohawk Park. As the search went on, into the night, the local PD got the county involved. I parked my cruiser at what I believe was the electric company storage yard, the yard had what I estimated to be a ten-foot fence that ran parallel to a paved bike trail on the other side of which runs a large concrete spillway to siphon off flood waters. I arrived at what I estimate to be roughly 11:30 PM to 11:45 PM. I estimate only because I assure you there never was, nor will be, an official statement or record with my name on it telling this story. As I left the lot I was at the north end of the lake and headed west on foot There was a lot of brush and saplings between the spillway and trail so I proceeded on to the point the trail turns south near where cedar lake empties into the cedar river under the railroad tracks leading into Quaker oats. There are multiple tracks at the turn I mentioned before and only the track furthest from myself had a train on it.

It was the first of October and the weather was nice, round the seventies. Plenty of space to explore considering that the park is fifty-four acres. Containing a playground area, one baseball diamond with lights and a basketball court. The picnic area has five shelter houses, there is a horse ring with a barn and stadium, and two multi-purpose buildings. I love nature and so much space appealed to me when dealing with people. I took a few joints with me to help with the pain and keep me calm. The get together was from noon to whenever and a lot of people showed up. I bring cupcakes with us, which I feel like a dumbass to find out that Steve's friend was a di! abetic and sugar was a no no. So not a first good impression, oh well screw it.

During my walk I was taking pictures here and there on my phone, I love taking pictures. I noticed that I was being pulled to the woods behind the baseball diamond. Goosebumps covered my whole arms instantly. I knew I was being compelled to go to that spot, it was a very strong urge. I didn't feel anything evil or that, it was just extremely creepy to me that as strong as the pull was I knew something was there. So I took my phone out and stopped walking. I ended up close to this tree which caught my eye anyways and I took a few pictures then started walking back to where everyone was. Even though I still felt the strong urge to go where I was being pulled. Later that night when we were at home I was looking at my pictures I took and doing some grey scale pictures with them because they look awesome that way. I noticed the one picture I did in grey scale the tree, it had a spirit in it. You could see it so clearly, I showed it to Steve and he thought that was cool then asked what was that by the bush That's when I saw it, a pair of eyes staring at me in the area I was being pulled to! I got goosebumps immediately as soon as I saw that. I thought that what I had captured with my photo was a hellhound, but when I finally showed my pictures to my friend Teresa who was into ufos, Bigfoot and;and I knew she would be interested. When I told her where we went when I took my pictures she told me it wasn't a hellhound but a dogman.I'm a believer and have a very open mind, I have seen and experienced a lot. So to say that this is so cool, it is. She didn't think so and said I was lucky it didn't follow me home. But the truth is that I ! didn't feel threatened or anything by it.\nSubmitted File 1:\nDate and time\n10\/01\/2017 1:30 PM\u00a0"},"13":{"state":"Louisiana","state_abbrev":"LA","location":"Jefferson Parish","longitude":-90.1120696,"latitude":29.6498691,"date":"11\/17\/2012","summary":"11\/17\/2012 -\u00a0My encounter happened a few years ago, in South Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Here in Louisiana, we call county's parishes, in case you didn't know. ?I was hunting deer or wild pigs one night, on a protection levee system that was built to protect the town from hurricane flood waters. As I walked to where the levee turns off to the left, there was a canal woods that was about a 100 yards from some houses. To the left was a natural ridge that goes out, into swamps and marshes. Well; as I made that turn from the ridge of oak trees, I heard a growl. I thought it might have been a coyote or dog, so I walked slower. Then, I heard brush and a smaller size tree shake and another growl. I shined my light in the direction of the sound and saw a pair of eyes that were reflecting an amber\/yellow color. What surprised me was the fact that the brush was about 6 foot high and the eyes were about a foot above the brush! When I saw those eyes, I slowly backed up, while keeping my light on the thing. As I walked back to the turn, to head back to my truck, which was parked about 3\/4 of a mile away; it came out the woods. I lit the thing up with my light again. Now; I was probably 30 feet from it. I saw its whole body and face! The body was covered with black hair, with some brown mixed in. The hair was thickest around its head, neck, chest and upper back. It looked a lot like a lion\u2019s mane, but wasn\u2019t as pronounced; since all of the hair was the same color. It had pointy ears, with a little bit of hair coming off the points, making the ears seem a little longer. It stood on two legs, but the legs were weird and backwards like. The arms were really long; longer then the legs. Its hands were like a mixture of human and bear; like really big Raccoon front paws. It had paws, but it also had fingers. That\u2019s the only way to describe it. If you watch the movie, \u201cThe Howling,\u201d you\u2019ll get an idea what this thing looked like. It's as if whoever made that movie new something others didn\u2019t. Now; at this point, I was freaking out, so I pulled up my rifle. I hunt with a Romanian AK, with a camo paint job, I did myself. The way I was hunting wasn't exactly legal. That\u2019s why I took my Romanian AK. If I had to toss it, I wouldn\u2019t be out much money. The rounds I use are special rounds, made to hunt feral hogs. I\u2019ve dropped deer and hogs with these rounds before. 1 shot and they\u2019re done. But back to the story; as I pulled my rifle up, to the ready, it growled and walked a few steps toward me. I fired a round right into its chest area. I knew I had hit it, because the creature took a step back. As it stepped back, I ran toward my truck. That\u2019s when it let out a loud growl and a howl like I had never heard before. I grew up hunting and fishing and thought I knew everything in the woods, but I hadn\u2019t heard anything like the sounds it made before. As I ran back to the truck, it stalked me, but kept its distance. As I got close to the well-lit area, where my truck was parked, by the town library and elementary school, it stopped following me. I tried to find anyone who may have had similar encounters in the area, but all I could find was old legends of the Rougarou; which is pronounced, \u201cRue-Ga-Rue.\u201d I told my grandpa about what had happened, but told him it was a friend who had told me it happened to him. I also told him that it sounded like a crazy story to me. He told me when he was 17, in the same area, at night, hunting, he heard a howl like nothing he had ever heard before. He also told me that something had stalked him, as he ran home that night. He said he never saw what it was, but could hear it following him through the brush and swamps. That encounter has changed my life. My perception of what is real and what is not will never be the same again. I still haven't gotten over that night. I went back a few days after that incident and found 2 large dog tracks, as big as my hand. I wear a size LG glove."},"14":{"state":"Louisiana","state_abbrev":"LA","location":"Crowley","longitude":-92.3745761,"latitude":30.2140928,"date":"4\/18\/1998","summary":"04\/18\/1998 - Crowley Louisiana population 13435 -down the railroad tracks about 2 miles is an old plant nursery \"the zigler plant nursery \" the old couple -the ziglers-are both now dead,but the 5acre homestead is now owned by A veterinarian -dr.Artall,who lives on the property .

I got bored, so I went outside to see if I could do anything with my chickens, like feed them worms and snails. Before I go into more detail, I should explain the area I live in. My home is on the outskirts of the city I live in. I had about 5 or 7 chickens at the time, and we hadn\u2019t expanded the coop, so it was a small pen connecting to two sides of the chicken coop, which is wooden and sturdy; the only ways to get into the coop is either through the trap door attached to the big door and the three windows; one window is on one side of the door and the second window on the other side. The third window is a large window. Keep in mind that they all have traps connected to them so they can be closed. We have 7 acres of woodland that we call the \u201cback pasture,\u201d and if you\u2019ve ever been back there you could see that it\u2019s a popular habitat for the local deer; there was also a wild boar that was roaming around at the time, and I don\u2019t know how it got there. We had been having trouble with poachers for a while, considering the population of deer in the woods. One poacher had set up a trail cam, one that was motion-activated. There was an old rusty deer stand that had been put on a tree a long time ago, and the tree had begun to grow around it. Beyond our acres of woods, there\u2019s a large cornfield owned by our neighbors, and beyond that is a forest. I don\u2019t know what the forest is like beyond the field since we\u2019ve never been there. I went outside to do something with my chickens, and I had brought along a bucket of corn for feeding the deer after. When I walked out of my home, I saw a doe was sitting in the tall grass; I thought it was sleeping since it had its head down and wasn\u2019t moving. I, being the curious little nut I was, decided that I would sneak up on the deer and get a picture of it to show to my mother when she got home from work. I crept as silently as I could across the yard that separated me from the deer. I should also mention that we have a clearing with a burn pit in it that was filled with cedar branches. I was creeping across my yard towards the deer, and when I had cleared the burn pit and was about ten yards from it I realized that the deer wasn\u2019t asleep, but it was dead. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen; its intestines were completely gone, the flesh on the body of the doe shredded to pieces and blood absolutely everywhere. It looked as if it had been sitting there for a while, and it smelled like it, too; most of the blood was dried and the air reeked with the stench of rotting flesh, urine, and what seemed like a hint of wet dog. Something that creeped me out about the scene was although it was a rotting carcass, there were no insects at all around it; it was as if the usual lively forest was deader than the deer. Not even the neighbor\u2019s cattle made a sound. It looked as if the poor deer had simply been left after being brutally attacked and half-eaten, which it most likely was. I left the bucket at the beginning of the trail, thinking that I would come out later with my mother and grain the deer when she got home. Then, I started to walk back to my house. I had barely taken a few steps when I heard a low, snarling growl that sounded like a wolf, although it seemed distorted as if it were being played on an old radio(sorry, that\u2019s the only way I think of describing it). Against my better judgment, I turned my head around, and I saw what looked like the biggest freaking wolf I\u2019d ever seen. It was on all fours, its fur was black and matted in places; its face was what you\u2019d expect a wolf to look like, although it was broad and the muzzle seemed a little short, although the way it was curling its lips made it look as if its snout was plenty long, and its eyes were yellow; not a bright yellow like the yellow of a flower or the sun, but a dim, amber, red yellow, if that makes sense. Its ears looked like that of a Doberman pincer, with the cropped effect. Its front legs were long, and it looked as if it were a body builder. Its \u201cpaws,\u201d if you can even call them paws, looked like huge hands with long claws at the end of them. It stood up, and I heard the most sickening popping sound you could ever imagine. It sounded like the sound of popping joints, but it seemed amplified as if it were being played through a microphone and the sound was coming out of loud speakers. Its body looked like a body builder\u2019s pumped up on steroids, it was so big. It had no tail, that I could tell, and it seemed to tower over me, although I was a good 10 meters from it. I was about five foot four inches at the time, and I came nowhere close to its height; it was so tall that the tip of its ears could almost touch the top of a young cedar. It let out a loud howl, which sounded more like a roar and it charged at me. Doing the only thing I knew to do while hyped up on fear and adrenaline, I began to run away from it. I remember clearing my yard in what seemed like hours but was most likely only a few seconds, and running inside, slamming and locking all of the doors and windows. As I calmed down a small bit, I had realized that if it had really wanted to kill me that it would have; that what I had experienced was not an attack charge, but a bluff. I was lucky to get away with my life.\nAlthough this happened almost two years ago, it still terrifies me to think about it. The deer was gone the next day, and ever since that evening I have been weary around the woods, only going in them in broad daylight, only when I absolutely had to, and never without a weapon. Sadly, I cannot say that I am one of those people that have stopped experiencing things after the encounter, although I only had nightmares for a month after that day in June. Nothing really started to happen again until about 2 months ago when I was staying up at night playing on the laptop. I had started to hear things moving around on the porch and turned on the light to see the shape of something huge disappearing behind the corner of my house. There was also one of the rare times I went into the woods after the first encounter when I was helping my mother clear brush from the hunting clearing. I was going to get the mower, and was walking the trail to do so when I heard bipedal footsteps following me off to my side; they stopped whenever I stopped, and I eventually ran out of the woods and I haven\u2019t been back since.\nI asked my late great grandmother about the creature I had seen in the woods, and she informed me that there was something called the wolf-head man that stalked the Kansa tribe, preying on small children that strayed too far from their tepees. Later, I was informed by my history teacher that my house had actually been built on a tribal burial ground, and I have since been wondering if that had something to do with it. I hadn\u2019t heard about the wolf-head man before she had told me about it; when I saw that there were several eye-witness reports that were proved to be truthful, it made me feel a lot better about coming out with this information. I had attempted to tell people previous to this submission, but everyone either said I was stupid, crazy, or just a plain liar. One thing\u2019s for certain; I am not stupid, I am not crazy, and I am most definitely not a liar. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a Dogman.\nTime: 3:45 PM Date: 6\/8\/2015"},"22":{"state":"New Hampshire","state_abbrev":"NH","location":"Hillsborough County","longitude":-71.6673352,"latitude":42.8334794,"date":"6\/1\/2017","summary":"6\/1\/2017 - I was going through the hiking trails with my dog, behind my town\u2019s\nlocal high school, fairly late one night.

While my encounter was not as up-close and personal as many of your guests, it was none the less terrifying to me and I feel that it has forever changed me and the way I view the world. I had just arrived home, a few minutes after dusk, after visiting my parents. Our location is rural, but we do have a few neighbors within shouting distance of us. We have 33 acres of mixed forests and fields, with lots of thick brush, consisting mostly of briars. I had my 2 young children with me, in the Jeep (ages 2 yrs and 11 mo), when I pulled in the driveway that night. My husband was working late, with an emergency case. It was near fully dark when I arrived home. As soon as I stepped from my vehicle, I felt creeped out. It felt different outside. We have lots of peepers and crickets that would normally be making lots of noise. Even the birds are usually chirping until an hour or more past dark. This time, there was not a sound. It was very warm that evening, so the peepers should have been in full chorus. Because of my uneasy feeling, I was rushing to get the kids in the house, at the same time, and did not want to leave RJ in the car alone, for a minute, as I routinely do. He and our older daughter, who was asleep, are normally too heavy for me to carry together, at the same time. That night though, I grabbed them both, 1 in each arm, after finding my keys to the front door and carried them both. Usually, I would use the auto garage door, however, the opener did not work. When I reached the front door, at the top of the stairs and got situated, on the front porch, I put down Angelina, in order to open the front door. As soon as I turned my attention back to the front door, it happened. Somewhere to my left came a sound that will be forever seared into my memory. It started low and slowly increased to a moderately loud growl. It was deep-toned and very guttural and was angry\/hateful in character. It was nothing like anything I had ever heard before, but it did sound canine in origin, especially after spending an hour listening to various animal growls. The growl continued for approximately 10 seconds. I was so terrified, I was fumbling with the keys. It really felt like I was dropped into an 80's horror film. I really did think I was going to die. I was sure any second, the thing making this sound was going to pounce upon me and the kids and eat us, right on the spot. The growl sounded as though the creature was standing just off to my left. I refused to look out of fear of what I would see. It sounded so close and at or even above eye level with me. My porch extends another 5 feet to the left and then off the porch is the front of the house. There\u2019s 35 yards of grass to the edge of the tree line and there\u2019s a field with 2 foot tall grass opposite that. There\u2019s also a small shed between our porch and the tree line. Standing on the front porch, from my head to the ground is approximately 9 feet. So, I assume it was standing near the corner of the house. I had never been so afraid, until a few moments later, when it actually spoke to me. As the growl continued, it seemed to melt into audible words, spoken in a very deep and gruff tone, that seemed to have a rough sort of reverberation quality to them. What I heard as clear as day was, \"You can't get in.\" The only word that I\u2019m unsure of is the first, \u201cYou.\u201d As the sound of growl transitioned to English words and it sounded more like Yyyyhhh. Now, I was histerical and dropping the keys. Finally, I got the right one in and got the door open and got in. I had to kick my daughter through the door, regretfully. Strangely, she seemed oblivious to what had just transpired, as if she didn't hear it. I slammed the door shut and never looked. I didn\u2019t hear anything else that night. I called my husband and his friend, to let them know what happened. So, I never did actually see what terrorized me, because I couldn\u2019t look. I\u2019ve had 2 days to to think about this encounter and talk with my husband, who has listened to every episode of Dogman Encounters Radio. I\u2019m fairly certain that this was what was growling at me. The sound was not human and seemed like it was amped or miked up, because it seemed so powerful. Not that it was a loud growl, but it seemed unnatural. Also, the height it seemed to emanate from and the silence that preceded it lead me to that conclusion. My husband agrees, because the entire week, he too has been on edge. We have lived here for a year and all seemed normal, until this week. Our cat, which is an indoor cat, got out accidentally and has vanished, without a trace. She has gotten out before and just stood around, until we got her back in the house. Also, my husband said Tuesday night, he experienced the silence outside and it really unnerved him too. He says he has never experienced anything so eerie. On Wednesday, he took our dog up into the woods, to look for our cat and felt very uneasy. He said the dog kept tucking its tail and turning around, wanting to go home. It\u2019s not like our dog or my husband to feel uneasy in the woods, because both of them love the outdoors and are very comfortable in nature. On Thursday, at dusk, he took the dog around the back lot and says something took off from the thickets, at a sprint and came crashing through the woods, down the hill, towards him. He always carries a sidearm when he is out and is normally not afraid of anything, but he actually turned and ran back up towards the house. Whatever was charging stopped seconds after he stopped to listen and did not make another sound. He was very concerned when he came in, stating that he knows what big game sounds like and that this was, \"Just not right\". Even he was surprised that he ran from the sound. The following day was when my encounter happened. After talking about all of these events with my husband, we are concerned that there is a Dogman in the area. My husband listened to Episodes 90 and 91 and is so worried that this thing has decided to stalk 1 or both of our kids. My husband said that based on those episodes, it sounds like the Dogman plans ahead when snatching kids and he thinks it may have been scouting the area, with plans to do just that. He said it was doing that or that it was waiting for me to leave 1 of the kids in the jeep, for a minute. Either way, none of this is good. The main reason why I wanted to submit this was because it seems very unique in that it spoke to me. It wasn\u2019t the words, but the feeling it gave me that disturbed me most. It was as if it was trying to give me the impression that I was nothing and that I was weak and just food. I got the impression that it was saying \u201cCan't get in,\u201d like \u201cHa ha! You\u2019re mine!\u201d It's hard to explain, because it seemed like It was conveying its frame of mind and that it was, for lack of a better description, making fun of me, in a very cruel way. I really want to know if you have ever heard of 1 of these monsters actually speaking. My husband and I really want to believe that our conclusions are wrong, but instinct and your show have us highly convinced that it in fact was a Dogman. We thank you deeply, for keeping the show going, being informed, and not leading us to believe that the monster is probably literally hiding out and waiting for us. That just might save 1 or all of our lives. Thank you for all that you do. Please let us know what you think about all of this."},"24":{"state":"Arizona","state_abbrev":"AZ","location":"Navajo County","longitude":-110.1402594,"latitude":35.4019765,"date":"7\/2\/2015","summary":"7\/2\/2015 -\u00a0While scanning the valley floor, for sheep, a mile from my house, I noticed two loping figures.

No animal could be that big on the rez. I watched the 2 figures until they disappeared into the woods, across the valley.

Literally. I will be short and simple about my encounter. I was getting home late one day, after dropping my sister off at the airport in Lamar, Colorado. I live just under 7 miles north of the Oklahoma border, on 250 acres of land. I have a trap line running around my property for coyotes. The first 2 traps I checked were empty, so I headed south. That\u2019s when I saw this thing. At first, I thought it was a coyote. A BIG coyote! It was almost 5 feet tall, on all fours! It was caught in my trap and was running around, making a dust cloud, and then it stopped and looked at me. Now, I use a Duke No. 3 leg-hold trap, so I can catch a variety of things in it. Anyways, I slammed on the brakes and my truck stalled, because it\u2019s a manual. I was fumbling for the keys to start it. It\u2019s an old farm truck, with a carburetor on it and it had quite an after-fire. Once it heard that, it lunged at me and roared. I saw that it had its hand (not paw but a hand) caught in my trap (right hand to be exact). It had probably been looking for the dead rabbit I had in the bait hole next to the trap. It then stood up and ripped the 2 earth anchors I had, 24 inches in the ground, right out! It took me a long time to put them in with a 10-pound hammer, but it pulled them straight out, within 15 seconds. After it did that, it just stood there, looking at me. It felt like an eternity and I knew my .357 would do nothing to stop this thing if it came at me. I prayed to God that it wouldn\u2019t come for me, in my truck. I was looking at it in shock and awe and noticed that it had orange eyes. They weren\u2019t glowing. Instead, they had a tint, like a cats eyes in the dark. They may have been reflecting my headlights. I can\u2019t be sure. It then took a step towards me, curled up its upper lip, showing me its teeth. They were huge! The longest 2 had to have been 4-5 inches long! It then growled at me and then it was gone in the blink of an eye. I was scared crapless then! I jammed the truck into gear and spun the tires, getting out of dodge! Like I said earlier, it seemed like an eternity, but it must have lasted no more than 30 seconds at the max.\n\nI later returned with an Indian friend of mine. He is part Arapaho. I grew up with him and trusted him. He told me some stories that were passed down through his grandparent\u2019s tribe and mentioned something about a Loup Garou or french werewolf. He also told me how fur trappers, in the late 1700\u2019s-1800\u2019s, were chased off the land in the Rockies from this thing. After some research online, I found your channel and here I am now. I really am glad you have made this channel for people who have encountered these things. I use to work \u2019till about 10-11 at night, but I sleep with the lights on now. It sounds silly for a 24-year-old to be doing that, but to be honest to God, I\u2019m still frightened by this thing.

You have to cross the train tracks twice to get to my house. After the second crossing is our neighbors that hang all kinds of crazy signs about Giants in the woods, Government cover ups, and the HooDoo legend of the Howler. We've always thought these people were talking about Sasquatch. We are members of the BFRO, but we never guessed a chance for Dogman. We were passing the loonie house and it was around 22:00 with clear vision. There's a bullpine treeline to my right and a hillside to the left, and my property straight on top of the hill. My brights were on and I remember scanning the treeline as we were passing, and about 12ft up were TWO RED REFLECTED EYES, SURROUNDED BY A BLACK MASS WITH SHOULDERS, NO NECK, AND PRONOUNCED EARS. My shock caused me to ditch the from not paying attention to the road. We were high centered for about 5 minutes, I stepped out to lock my hubs, and I remember that OVERWHELMING FEELING OF BEING WATCHED, which hurried my project. When I got back in the car, the feeling didn't go away. I quickly got out of the ditch and sped up the hill to the house. My Mom was asking me why I was so worried, which she later found out why. About midnight, Mom was woken up by THE MOST GUTTERAL HOWLING YOU CAN IMAGINE. Mom yelled at me threw the house if I was awake, and I had already had my window cracked and listening to the sounds that we STILL HEAR every now and then. I then later looked for anyone who knew anything about what I saw. I then located Mr. Vic who runs \"Dogman Encounters\" on the east coast. He gave me the best info he could, which was extremely helpful. I then ARMED MYSELF WITH AN AR15, .45 REVOLVER, AND A .380. It was the best I had at the time. I figured a guy on the phone might be full of it, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE TRUTH IS TO FIND IT YOURSELF. I tracked threw the snow to the location I seen the eyes and the exact tree. There were NO TRACKS IN THE SNOW! I thought I was just seeing things and got all worked up over nothing, but then I looked up. around 13-15 feet up the tree, and about 7 feet up as well were CLAW MARKS DUG INTO THE TREE. I started looking for other trees and sure enough, THERE WAS A TRAIL OF CLAW MARKS FROM TREE TO TREE. Eventually the mistery trail came to an end and gave into another shocking trail. Large enough to dwarf a lion print were THE LARGEST DOG PRINTS I'VE EVER SEEN! The Trail seemed to step over large brush piles and bushes, eventually it lead to the quad trail that follows the lower part of my property and HooDoo Lake. What I saw next still lies there. A DEER CARCASS WITH NO HEAD, NO HIND QUARTERS, AND NO VITAL ORGANS. On closer examination, the neck bone was crumbled and shattered surrounded by torn flesh. Both legs were broken with no bite marks, and the ribs had been separated in a pattern that indicated hyperextention. There was a lot of scuffle in the snow from cyotes, but I've never seen cyotes leave the breast meat and back straps? What concerned me even more was, I found a leg wedged in the fork of a thin pine about 12 ft off the ground. THIS TREE COULDN'T SUPPORT A BOBCAT. I've never gone back in the woods behind my house without being armed since. My neighbors now think I'm the crazy one. I dress in full combat gear when I set trail cams. I guess I am the weird one now, but I will tell you this, there is something in my woods that has the rancher across the street thinking a Grizzly attacked his cows in November. Every neighbor hears the howls. I asked my land lord at the bar if he had seen or herd anything while he was living here, and his face went white as a ghost. I haven't had a sighting since, but I did have an ice ball thrown at my car, and there's no kids in this neighborhood. \nSubmitted File 1:\n\nDate and time\n11\/15\/2017 10:00 PM\u00a0"},"27":{"state":"Kansas","state_abbrev":"KS","location":"Jackson County","longitude":-95.8142885,"latitude":39.4241422,"date":"6\/8\/2015","summary":"6\/8\/2015 - Since it was summer break for my school, I was lazily lounging at home watching TV. I got bored, so I went outside to see if I could do anything with my chickens, like feed them worms and snails. Before I go into more detail, I should explain the area I live in. My home is on the outskirts of the city I live in. I had about 5 or 7 chickens at the time, and we hadn\u2019t expanded the coop, so it was a small pen connecting to two sides of the chicken coop, which is wooden and sturdy; the only ways to get into the coop is either through the trap door attached to the big door and the three windows; one window is on one side of the door and the second window on the other side. The third window is a large window. Keep in mind that they all have traps connected to them so they can be closed. We have 7 acres of woodland that we call the \u201cback pasture,\u201d and if you\u2019ve ever been back there you could see that it\u2019s a popular habitat for the local deer; there was also a wild boar that was roaming around at the time, and I don\u2019t know how it got there. We had been having trouble with poachers for a while, considering the population of deer in the woods. One poacher had set up a trail cam, one that was motion-activated. There was an old rusty deer stand that had been put on a tree a long time ago, and the tree had begun to grow around it. Beyond our acres of woods, there\u2019s a large cornfield owned by our neighbors, and beyond that is a forest. I don\u2019t know what the forest is like beyond the field since we\u2019ve never been there. I went outside to do something with my chickens, and I had brought along a bucket of corn for feeding the deer after. When I walked out of my home, I saw a doe was sitting in the tall grass; I thought it was sleeping since it had its head down and wasn\u2019t moving. I, being the curious little nut I was, decided that I would sneak up on the deer and get a picture of it to show to my mother when she got home from work. I crept as silently as I could across the yard that separated me from the deer. I should also mention that we have a clearing with a burn pit in it that was filled with cedar branches. I was creeping across my yard towards the deer, and when I had cleared the burn pit and was about ten yards from it I realized that the deer wasn\u2019t asleep, but it was dead. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen; its intestines were completely gone, the flesh on the body of the doe shredded to pieces and blood absolutely everywhere. It looked as if it had been sitting there for a while, and it smelled like it, too; most of the blood was dried and the air reeked with the stench of rotting flesh, urine, and what seemed like a hint of wet dog. Something that creeped me out about the scene was although it was a rotting carcass, there were no insects at all around it; it was as if the usual lively forest was deader than the deer. Not even the neighbor\u2019s cattle made a sound. It looked as if the poor deer had simply been left after being brutally attacked and half-eaten, which it most likely was. I left the bucket at the beginning of the trail, thinking that I would come out later with my mother and grain the deer when she got home. Then, I started to walk back to my house. I had barely taken a few steps when I heard a low, snarling growl that sounded like a wolf, although it seemed distorted as if it were being played on an old radio(sorry, that\u2019s the only way I think of describing it). Against my better judgment, I turned my head around, and I saw what looked like the biggest freaking wolf I\u2019d ever seen. It was on all fours, its fur was black and matted in places; its face was what you\u2019d expect a wolf to look like, although it was broad and the muzzle seemed a little short, although the way it was curling its lips made it look as if its snout was plenty long, and its eyes were yellow; not a bright yellow like the yellow of a flower or the sun, but a dim, amber, red yellow, if that makes sense. Its ears looked like that of a Doberman pincer, with the cropped effect. Its front legs were long, and it looked as if it were a body builder. Its \u201cpaws,\u201d if you can even call them paws, looked like huge hands with long claws at the end of them. It stood up, and I heard the most sickening popping sound you could ever imagine. It sounded like the sound of popping joints, but it seemed amplified as if it were being played through a microphone and the sound was coming out of loud speakers. Its body looked like a body builder\u2019s pumped up on steroids, it was so big. It had no tail, that I could tell, and it seemed to tower over me, although I was a good 10 meters from it. I was about five foot four inches at the time, and I came nowhere close to its height; it was so tall that the tip of its ears could almost touch the top of a young cedar. It let out a loud howl, which sounded more like a roar and it charged at me. Doing the only thing I knew to do while hyped up on fear and adrenaline, I began to run away from it. I remember clearing my yard in what seemed like hours but was most likely only a few seconds, and running inside, slamming and locking all of the doors and windows. As I calmed down a small bit, I had realized that if it had really wanted to kill me that it would have; that what I had experienced was not an attack charge, but a bluff. I was lucky to get away with my life.\n\nAlthough this happened almost two years ago, it still terrifies me to think about it. The deer was gone the next day, and ever since that evening I have been weary around the woods, only going in them in broad daylight, only when I absolutely had to, and never without a weapon. Sadly, I cannot say that I am one of those people that have stopped experiencing things after the encounter, although I only had nightmares for a month after that day in June. Nothing really started to happen again until about 2 months ago when I was staying up at night playing on the laptop. I had started to hear things moving around on the porch and turned on the light to see the shape of something huge disappearing behind the corner of my house. There was also one of the rare times I went into the woods after the first encounter when I was helping my mother clear brush from the hunting clearing. I was going to get the mower, and was walking the trail to do so when I heard bipedal footsteps following me off to my side; they stopped whenever I stopped, and I eventually ran out of the woods and I haven\u2019t been back since.\n\nI asked my late great grandmother about the creature I had seen in the woods, and she informed me that there was something called the wolf-head man that stalked the Kansa tribe, preying on small children that strayed too far from their tepees. Later, I was informed by my history teacher that my house had actually been built on a tribal burial ground, and I have since been wondering if that had something to do with it. I hadn\u2019t heard about the wolf-head man before she had told me about it; when I saw that there were several eye-witness reports that were proved to be truthful, it made me feel a lot better about coming out with this information. I had attempted to tell people previous to this submission, but everyone either said I was stupid, crazy, or just a plain liar. One thing\u2019s for certain; I am not stupid, I am not crazy, and I am most definitely not a liar. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a Dogman."},"28":{"state":"Kansas","state_abbrev":"KS","location":"Jackson County","longitude":-95.8142885,"latitude":39.4241422,"date":"9\/13\/2013","summary":"9\/13\/2013 -\u00a0Before I say anything about my encounter, I just want to clarify that when I saw this thing, I went to Google and searched up what it was. I came across this website and found that another person in Jackson County had had an encounter with something like this, so I know I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019d been studying wolves and their behavior for about 3 years before I had this encounter, and I know that considering Jackson County is about 656 square miles with a population of 674,158 and it being practically infested with wildlife such as deer, livestock, and predators such as coyotes and foxes, it wouldn\u2019t be likely for a large predator such as a wolf to be lurking in the sparse woodland. The average wolf territory is 13 \u2013 2,400 mi\u00b2, and it\u2019d be easy for such a huge creature to live just in Jackson County alone. This may even be the very same dog-wolf-man thing that the other person saw. Anyway, on to the encounter. I was just chillin\u2019 on the laptop in the living room, watching people blow stuff up, when I felt like I had to go to the bathroom. I set the laptop down and put my headphones on the keyboard and got out of the chair. Let me clarify, I\u2019m not a bloody psychic or a medium or anything, but I have a sort of sixth sense where I can tell if something is watching me, and I knew something was. We have a huge window on the wall just above the couch, and it was a particularly cold night, so the windows caught things like breath fairly well. I turned to the window, thinking that whatever it was watching me from there, and I knew I\u2019d see it if it was(we have motion-sensing floodlights), and it\u2019d have to be either standing on something or tall as the devil himself in order to see into the window of our trailer(it was around 6-8 feet off the ground, with the top of it being about 11 feet). I looked over to the window, and the only thing I could see was that the floodlights were on and something seemed to duck under the window, like a kid playing hide-and-seek. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, considering our neighbors were a sort of druggies and alcoholics and often came to look in our windows, and every opening to the house was locked, so I had nothing to worry about. I went to the bathroom, and when I finished I washed my hands and went back to the laptop. I noticed that the floodlights went out, so whatever it was gone. Not thinking anything else of it, I went back to watching people blow stuff up. I should mention also that my eyes are sharp, sharp enough to spot a bird about 50 feet away in a tree, so it\u2019s no surprise that when the floodlights came back on I noticed immediately. I glanced up from the screen, expecting a drunken or high idiot to be looking in with a stupid expression on his face, but I was frozen by what I saw. It was a huge, huge wolf, that was looking at me with dirty ambery-yellow eyes. Its ears looked like they were torn or Cropped or something, and the face looked sort of human-like. Not really a full human face, but more like the jawline looked very masculine and human compared to the rest of its face. Its lips were curled back and it seemed as if it were snarling, though I couldn\u2019t hear it if it was, and its breath caught on the cold glass. It was so tall that the top of its head was halfway up the window, and if I had to guess how wide it was I\u2019d probably say maybe the width of my shoulders. I knew that whatever it was, it most likely had wolfish instincts, so I did the only thing I knew to do, which was avoid eye contact and make yourself look as small as you could whilst having your throat and underside showing. This is a very common submissive position, and although I was scared out of my mind, I knew that holding eye contact would make me seem like a challenger and running would make me seem like prey. When I did the submissive position it must\u2019ve worked for it to leave me alone because it just hit the window, which made the entire trailer shake, and it went away. I hadn\u2019t heard or seen anything else like it since, although I do hear the odd howl coming from the backroads. God help the poor idiot that decides to try and hunt this thing down. I can tell you know that whatever it was was NOT friendly because if it were, it wouldn\u2019t have slammed my window as hard as it had, and it would not have been growling like I\u2019d taken its food. Although it practically did assault my window, I could understand why it was upset. I was on its territory, after all, an intruder and possibly a threat to its existence and its prey. It\u2019s really just best to stay out if its way and respect it. After all, it is one of God\u2019s many strange creatures in the world."},"29":{"state":"Montana","state_abbrev":"MT","location":"Carbon County","longitude":-109.100255,"latitude":45.2820195,"date":"8\/15\/2004","summary":"8\/15\/2004 - I'm probably the youngest person to come to you about this.

One night, I woke up and noticed a shilouette, standing outside my window. My eyes focused and I saw that it had a furry outline and these frost blue eyes it was using to look at me. I sat up in my bed, frightened, but I didn't feel the need to yell for my parents or anything. It just kind of stared at me.

It was fairly muscular and was almost resting on my window sill, like it was leaning up against it. We stared at each other for a good couple of minutes.

Like most nights I sat down on my back porch and lit a cigarette and relaxed. However unlike most nights I heard something new. I am used to coyotes, and my neighbors dogs barking, but in this case I heard something new. It sounded like a deep howl, but instead of the usual dog sound it stayed as one tone and it was octaves deeper. I heard it go from backyard to backyard and the neighbors dogs took notice. The dogs barking triggered one of my dogs to run out to the fence line and she began to bark at something unseen(at least from my perspective) I got up and I told her, \"Hey come back in girl its ok\". She turned to me and she sat there utterly frozen in fear. It took a few minutes to break her out of this, and she bolted to the back door. I decided to poke my head out of the gate and look into the field behind the fence. By the treeline I saw these amber colored eyes standing about 5 ft above the ground. I decided to run in and took up my knife and ran out in the direction of the eyes. The whole time I walked I heard the howls. However though when I got close to where I initially saw these eyes, every sound stops. You could literally hear a pin drop. Where I didn't see anything, I felt the presence of something watching me. After a few moments I walked back to the porch and sat and had another smoke. It was then the howls started again...This time though thy came from my neighbors backyard. They have two shepherds and I will never forget this sound. I first heard this guttural growl noise unlike anything I've heard before, then one of the shepherds shrieked and then I heard the other get slammed against the fence. One thing lad to another and I heard my neighbor fire off a round and then I heard this thing trail off. The next encounter was just three nights ago. I heard the howls start up again, but this time I heard it making its way through the treeline behind the back lot of my house. I heard the thumping of its feet, and branches were snapping.My instincts kicked in to get to cover so I shut off the back porch light and allowed my eyes to get adjusted. There was enough light to clearly see the opening in the treeline that's about two of me wide, and about 9+ ft high. I watched in the direction where the noises were coming from then all of a sudden I see it stand up. I first saw the ears tall and sharp like knives. I then saw its head,followed by its broad shoulders and long arms. It stood there watching me for what seemed like forever until it turned and ducked down a little, and took massive strides on two legs to walk off. Its because of this I've been conducting an investigation on this thing. I learned there was an encounter in Firestone county not very far from me. I hope to get reasonable evidence soon.\nSubmitted File 1:\n\nDate and time\n04\/23\/2018 4:00 AM\u00a0"},"32":{"state":"Texas","state_abbrev":"TX","location":"Freestone County","longitude":-96.1526985,"latitude":31.7534889,"date":"4\/23\/2016","summary":"4\/23\/2016 - I was out at my grandparent\u2019s house, hunting coyotes, as usual, this time of year.

Theres a 2-3ft barrow ditch running along the road and the dogmans head was level with his as he was driving so Jon puts its height at 7 to 8 ft. It was dark in color with grey or white on its muzzle running from its nose to under its eyes which were amber in color. He sped up to 45 and the dogman kept up with him often looking inside the pickup. He said at around 50mph he lost it and thats all he would tell me. \nSubmitted File 1:\n\nDate and time\n10\/15\/2010 1:30 AM\u00a0"},"34":{"state":"Colorado","state_abbrev":"CO","location":"Pueblo","longitude":-104.6091409,"latitude":38.2544472,"date":"1\/28\/2018","summary":"Name:\nTammy\nReport Title:\nDogman Plus Other Crypts On My Place For Years\nDogman Sighting details::\nHi folks. I do not want my name out on the internet because it never goes away. Anyway, a few years ago I decided to contact the BFRO about having Yetis' (Bigfoot) on my place. I call them Yeti because they have three toes instead of five. I always knew we had more than one cryptid on the place. I live on a river, and have about 18 acres of land. The dogman has been sighted off Lime Road which also borders my river. I am from Pueblo, Colorado and I live on the St. Charles River which dumps into the Arkansas River. My researchers had me put out cams to see if I could catch any Bigfoot activity. I did, and over the years have caught other strange creatures on cam. I call them hybrids. My encounters started when I was 8 years old in 1969 when a huge Bigfoot stood up in front of my dads Allis Charmers Tractor and it has continued to this day with other creatures as well. I have a pic of the dogman I caught in the river. It takes up a span of four feet wide. He has huge shoulders and is staring directly at the camera across from it. Yes, it is black, has ears that tip in towards themselves, and scars on its face and it appears he is not too happy about having his picture taken. I felt very vindicated when I got that pic and I blew it up in word so I could get a good look at the creature. Quite ugly to say the least. It is a daylight pic, right about when the sun is setting. Good pic anyway. In the pic he is not standing but buffed out squatting, looking at the cam. That's not all guys. I keep my big dogs in at night because I don't want them killed. I have an older Blue Heeler and an Irish Wolf hound mix. He's not as big as an Irish Wolf hound but non the less is fast and aggressive. I almost lost him last fall he was three at the time. I came home and he wasn't there to greet me. I found him pretty beat up with a 6 inch slice at his groin which almost cut into his phenol artery. He had no bite marks at all, but he was beat all over his body like something pulverized him. He was so swollen that you could push in on the swelling like you were pushing in on semi inflated balloon. I called my pasture neighbor who indeed said there was a fight in the river at about 9:00 am.She said it sounded horrible and heard a dog screaming. Well, I said it was my dog. It changed my dogs personality, he is more cautious, and when these creatures are around will not leave my side nor will he venture to the river. Irish Wolf hounds are ear, sight, and smell dogs and when he stands on his hind legs or raises his head smelling the air and turns around and comes back to me, something is a foot in the river. I have had many instances with these creatures on my place and I have lost a few good dogs to that river and what runs it. If you want the pic send me an e-mail. My researchers are mostly into Bigfoot and do not come around much anymore. Matter of fact, one moved away to another part of Colorado. They are cryptologists. Gentlemen, be very careful with going into the woods with these things. I can prove these creatures, and the others are not what we know as normal animals. Dogmen are very hard to kill as well as Bigfoot or as well as the other creatures on my place. I hope you carry a very large caliber weapon when out humping it in the woods. I have a pic of a hybrid that has kind of an ape like face, huge shoulders, not much body and African lion feet. You can see four shadows in that pic and it's quite a pic. Broad daylight, bright morning, and when I sent it to my researchers they added some color to the pic to see the creature better and sent it back to me. This is why I say dogman, Bigfoot and the other crypts out there are giants of old. I saw something last summer, but your text box won't let me type any further. E-mail me if you care too. They are dangerous friends, never doubt that.\nSubmitted File 1:\n\nDate and time\n01\/28\/2018 7:30 PM"}}
